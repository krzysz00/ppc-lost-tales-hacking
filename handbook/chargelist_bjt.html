<b>MEMORANDUM</b>

<b>To:</b> All Assassination and Reconnaissance Departments
<br/>
<b>From:</b> <a href="http://plotprotectors.tripod.com/handbook/flowers.html">The Sunflower Official</a>
<br/><br/>
Please find enclosed the current official list of basic offenses against Canon for which fan-written characters in your departments may be charged with disrupting the Continuum. As all agents are to a certain extent autonomous while in the field, amplification of these rudimentary charges is encouraged as long as it does not violate Canon Protection Initiative policy. It is noted that the list is not exhaustive and is subject to further revision. To nominate a frequent or egregious offense for inclusion on the list, simply contact the Department of Records, Accounting, and Tabulation (<a href="mailto:kaylsraven@yahoo.com">DRAT</a>). <i>Please</i> do <i>not</i> ask for a raise while doing so.

<p><b>NOTES:</b></p>

<p>1. Some charges may be listed under more than one section of this document.<br/>
2. This document is in no way an exhaustive list of possible entries for a charge list, but instead encompasses the most frequently used charges which are authorized by PPC Headquarters and will be supported by the Legal Department if dispute arises.<br/>
3. The main and first entry on any charge list for the Department of Mary-Sues is <b>&quot;Being a Mary-Sue.&quot;</b> This item is mandatory for inclusion on a DMS charge list, but must be substantiated by other charges in order to be legally recognized.</p>

<p><b>Mini-Lorns</b>: mini-Lorns are the Official Black Jewels Fanfiction University's version of OFUM's mini-Balrogs. They are approximately two to two and a half feet high (although Titan is three feet, as she can’t decide between her name-sake, Titian, or an actual Titan) and, as a detailed description of Lorn was never given, decided to be black
with wings. (Yes, OBFU and the PPC realize that his scales are translucent when removed from his body, but there is no telling what color his skin is.) The mini-Lorns tend to take some aspect of their name-sake: for instance, all of Daemon’s mini-Lorns would quite cheerfully kill Dorothea’s, and just as cheerfully have paired off with Jaenelle’s minis.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: The PPC is the creation of Agents Jay Thorntree and Acacia Bird. The PPC Charge List was created by NenyaQuende, also known as Agent Nenya Gabriel of the PPC, Response Centre #1004, and was designed for Lord of the Rings fan fiction.
