<b><a name="A">A. PPC Initiation Rites (female applicants)</a></b>
<p>
One time, and one time only shall the Sacred Book of Rites be opened for all to see. If at any time the prospective agent chooses to turn back, she is grabbed by the scruff of the neck and tossed back in. <BR><BR>

To ensure that the new agent is prepared, she is given a short time for last words and prayer. Some initiates choose to invoke the power of various gods in order to give them strength. Typical sutras include "Oh Dear Eru" and the Dead 'Sue Sutra as transcribed below. <BR><BR>

"I will kill the 'Sue. <BR>
I will protect Canon. <BR>
But only after I have completed the charge list <BR>
And charged the 'Sue <BR>
Shall I kill her. <BR>
Grant me strength, <BR>
Mighty Tolkien, <BR>

That I may destroy <BR>
This abomination of your most holy work." <BR><BR>

Her mind must then be proven completely <a name="backfoot" style="text-decoration: none">insane<a><a href="#note" style="text-decoration: none">*</a> by passing through the Halls of Doom and facing therein a bored Kender, a Gibbering Mouther, her worst fear, and Tom Bombadil's poetry recital. <BR><BR>

Upon her exit from the Halls of Doom, she procedes to the final trial. She must capture a live specimen of the Warrior Sue breed (Homo perfectatus milites) for the final sacrifice. <BR><BR>

Once the sacrifice is secured, all agents present gather for the victory parade with their Minis and partners. Often strange chants and body paint are employed in decoration for the victory party. One agent has been known to wear the blue skin of a unicorn in this tribal ritual. A large bonfire is lit by the <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/bonsaimallorn/">DOGA</a> clan and the <a href="http://www.misssandman.com/PPC/story.html">Cactus</a> clan prepares the altar for the Sueish Sacrifice. <BR><BR>

The Sue is bound and gagged and led to the glitter-stained altar, whereupon she is sacrificed by use of canonical material. A passage from the world she has defiled is shown to her, and she explodes in a kaleidoscope of glittery sparkles as the gathered agents cheer. <BR><BR>

After this, there is much feasting and rejoicing as the gathered clans welcome a new member to the tribe. The new member is showered with gifts of a bottle of a strange substance called "Bleeprin" by the natives, and various other gifts including cough drops, pineapples, bacon, bumper-stickers, and beads. This celebration lasts for only a short time, because not long after... <BR><BR><b>[BEEEEEEEEEEEEEPPPPPPPPP]</b> <BR><BR>

<p>
Firstly, thou must obtain water from the Wellspring of the Sentient Paintbrushes. When 
thou hast done so, thou must bring it in the Bucket of Fated Destruction (which can be 
found only at the West Pole) to the Land of the Carnivorous Hairclips. With the 
Eyedropper of the Unbearable Stench thou must pour the water, drop by drop, on 
the Seed of Breakfast Waffles, which thou hast previously stolen from the 
burning house of the Priestess of Dry-Erase Markers under the light of a blue 
moon on a night when the cows are turning cartwheels, and buried at the exact 
spot where it can be an equal distance from every mushroom in the Echoing Grove, 
under the soil at the same depth as the tip of a stone spear stabbed into the 
ground with excitement by Eomer's third cousin's paternal grandmother's 
childhood enemy's great-granddaughter when her horse won its sixth race in a 
row. When the sprout has been visible for three solar eclipses, two lunar 
eclipses, and a Wednesday, thou shalt transplant it into a flowerpot that, at 
some point in time, had its rim chipped by a soldier with a black beard three 
feet long whose mother was from Germany and whose father was from England and 
whose ex-wife's great-aunt spoke with a lisp. The soil in the pot must be from 
the grave of a virgin who died while wearing rabbitskin slippers. Carry the pot 
in your left hand while keeping your right pinkie in your brother's ear. Do not 
pause to rest and do not look behind you (neither may your brother) until you 
have reached PPC headquarters. Find the reception center of a perfectly sane and 
stable assassin. There you must set the pot down in the place where a 
mini-Balrog has once stood while it willingly wore a ballgown. Using an 
unblooded, perfectly plain and unmagical dagger stolen from a Mary-Sue whose 
story does not have a single grammar or spelling mistake, cut the top inch and 
seven thirteenths of an inch of the plant exactly in half vertically. Pour into 
the center the blood of a politician who never told a lie until the plant 
overflows just enough that three drops spill down the outside of the stem. Walk 
around the pot six times backwards counterclockwise, all the while reciting an 
original sonnet in Westron about the evils of badfic and pledging never to write 
it excepting in parody. Then kneel a Narsil's length (before it was broken) away 
from the pot and clasp your hands with your right thumb over your left, holding 
them out before you. Raising your eyes upwards at a 72 degree angle, cry out 
your everlasting devotion to the goddess GreyLadyBast in the form of several 
acrostic haikus. Vertically, the first letter of every line must spell out the 
phrase "I am of the Protectors of the Plot Continuum." Do a twenty-eight minute 
long interpretive dance to the greatness of Tolkien. Scream at the top of your 
lungs until you lose consciousness from oxygen deprivation.<br>
