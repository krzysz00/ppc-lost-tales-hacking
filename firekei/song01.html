<p>A long, long time ago…<br/>
The horror I still remember<br/>
But the music blasted fear away<br/>
And I knew that if I had the chance<br/>
I’d throttle Makes-Things with a glance<br/>
And maybe I’d forget my spite one day…</p>

<p>But the memory did make me shiver<br/>
Each time the console <b>[BEEP!]</b> delivered<br/>
Another Sue to assassinate<br/>
My revenge would have to wait…</p>

<p>I don’t recall if I screamed and cried<br/>
(The Bleeprin memory denied) <br/>
But never more did my brain get fried<br/>
That day…the batteries…died.</p>

<p>So I’m singin’<br/>
Why, why, did my sanity die? <br/>
My fingers and my ears collide<br/>
‘LA-LA’ed till I cried<br/>
And my partner didn’t have batteries set aside<br/>
I thought ‘That’s it, my sanity is fried…’<br/>
‘That’s it, my sanity is <i>fried</i>.’</p>

<p>Well, my batteries gave up<br/>
Surrendered in this mass of schlup<br/>
The ‘elfish’ translator boomed<br/>
Bad grammar reigned and spell-check ran<br/>
(Her ‘music’ didn’t even scan) <br/>
And to the Sue a lust-object was doomed…</p>

<p>I know that it’s my duty<br/>
To destroy this Sueish ‘beauty’<br/>
But wilver-urple eyes<br/>
Last straw; you don’t get any prize</p>

<p>I shut my eyes, ignored A/Ns<br/>
Though Sue had conquered wood and glen<br/>
But all my luck ran out (again)<br/>
The day…the batteries…died.</p>

<p>I started singing,<br/>
Why, why, did my sanity die?<br/>
My fingers and my ears collide<br/>
‘LA-LA’ed till I cried<br/>
And my partner didn’t have batteries set aside<br/>
I thought ‘That’s it, my sanity is fried…’<br/>
‘That’s it, my sanity is <i>fried</i>.’</p>

<p>No numbing music to block the horror<br/>
As Mary played ‘magic Restorer’<br/>
I curled into a ball and sobbed<br/>
While she sang off-key to bad-played harp<br/>
I cringed alone within the dark<br/>
As Canonverse’s basis all was robbed</p>

<p>Through chapters I had suffered<br/>
Bad grammar unbuffered<br/>
Punctuation took vacation<br/>
(Stop the alliteration!)<br/>
While Sue recited bad flowery prose<br/>
And with poor, dazed lust-object posed<br/>
I sank to new depths of lows<br/>
The day the batteries…died.</p>

<p>I started singin’<br/>
Why, why, did my sanity die?<br/>
My fingers and my ears collide<br/>
‘LA-LA’ed till I cried<br/>
And my partner didn’t have batteries set aside<br/>
I thought ‘That’s it, my sanity is fried…’<br/>
‘That’s it, my sanity is <i>fried</i>.’</p>

<p>My partner strangely was immune<br/>
Rolled eyes as Sue fell to a swoon<br/>
For Bleeprin I searched all in vain<br/>
CDs I thought would block the pain<br/>
Alas, I knew batteries were slain<br/>
For music loud is quite the drain</p>

<p>Oh, no! For now my verse is turning Sue<br/>
And Legolas has caught the flu<br/>
For Sue to play the nurse<br/>
Yet-she is victim of a curse!<br/>
And any patient she heals takes<br/>
The energy her spirit makes<br/>
Oh, <i>please</i> just die already, fake<br/>
That’s right…my batteries died.</p>

<p>I was singin’<br/>
Why, why, did my sanity die?<br/>
My fingers and my ears collide<br/>
‘LA-LA’ed till I cried<br/>
And my partner didn’t have batteries set aside<br/>
I thought ‘That’s it, my sanity is fried…’<br/>
‘That’s it, my sanity is <i>fried</i>.’</p>

<p>Well, the story relentless continued<br/>
And homicidal turned my mood<br/>
My partner laughed as teeth I ground<br/>
The charge list built to a high<br/>
As chapter 18 then came nigh<br/>
I swore to Eru that Sue I would pound.</p>

<p>And as I watched her be the hero<br/>
Tolerance dropped to a zero<br/>
I charged into the scene<br/>
“ENOUGH!” at last I screamed<br/>
“This story has to stop right here,<br/>
Or my sanity will disappear”<br/>
Our Sue then tried to shed a tear<br/>
The day my batteries…died.</p>

<p>I was singin’<br/>
Why, why, did my sanity die?<br/>
My fingers and my ears collide<br/>
‘LA-LA’ed till I cried<br/>
And my partner didn’t have batteries set aside<br/>
I thought ‘That’s it, my sanity is fried…’<br/>
‘That’s it, my sanity is <i>fried</i>.’</p>

<p>Partner and I sang<br/>
My, my, you made my (her) sanity fry<br/>
You’re charged today, don’t you dare say<br/>
This all was a lie<br/>
To corny last words your right is denied<br/>
Sue, I’m glad to say good-bye…<br/>
Sue, I’m glad to say good-bye.</p>

<p>…good-bye!</p>

<p>(With apologies to Don McLean.)</p>
