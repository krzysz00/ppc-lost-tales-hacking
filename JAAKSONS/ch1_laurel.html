<b>Summary:</b> There was Nenya, who is called the Ranger-Luster, and Rosie, called the Sam Fan Extraordinaire, and they bethought themselves to join the <a href="http://oddlots.digitalspace.net/PPC">Protectors of the Plot Continuum</a>, out of love for Tolkien, admiration for Jay and Acacia, and general well-intentioned naiveté. With them came Glorfindal, mini-Balrog of <a href="http://www.misssandman.com/LOTR/ofum.html">OFUM</a>, and many were the adventures that followed them. The story they tackled in their first mission may be found <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/read.php?storyid=1173712">here</a>.<br/>

<b>Chapter 1: "Laurel"</b>
<br/>
<br/>
    
    nok nok nok<br/>
    <br/>
    Two girls stood outside a tall gray metal door. One was a few inches taller 
    than the other, but still rather short. She had dark red hair and blue eyes, 
    with glasses that were about three centimeters thick. She was wearing plain 
    jeans and a black shirt with white...jagged lines, it looked like, or are 
    those letters? You can never tell. A thin cloak of grey filmy material was 
    wrapped about her, fastened at the throat with a leaf-shaped brooch that 
    looks rather familiar.<br/>
    <br/>

    Her partner was short and rather round, with short brownish-blonde hair that 
    blew all around her face and got in her green-gray eyes. She wore dark jeans 
    and a shirt with what looked like monkeys hanging upside down on the front. 
    She also wore a cloak, nearly identical to the redhead’s, save with a 
    slightly different brooch, this one looking as if it were hand-crafted. The 
    two had been worried that the department might not take them on, seeing as how 
    many Sues have red hair and green eyes, but that was before the short one 
    had pointed out that they were applying because the poor people were so 
    understaffed and would take anyone...even them.<br/>
    <br/>
    Behind them, an altogether frightening beast towered a few feet above the 
    doorframe. He had all the physical characteristics of a Balrog, but he was 
    much smaller. His flame-whip was stowed carefully in his belt, and he was 
    doing his best to look docile. The redhead turned around after knocking and 
    patted him on the head, though she had to use a rather large step-stool to 
    do it.<br/>
    <br/>
    “You sure they’ll let you bring him in there?” asked the shorter one, eyeing 
    the creature dubiously.<br/>
    <br/>
    “They better,” her friend replied. “If they don’t want Glorfindal, they 
    don’t want me. Isn’t that right, Glori-poo?” she asked, hugging the 
    Mini-Balrog. He nuzzled her with his fiery nose.<br/>

    <br/>
    The redhead carried a dark blue backpack, a pillow, and a water bottle. 
    Glorfindal was carrying another black bag of hers. The blonde was 
    substantially more loaded down, with a larger pillow, a much more 
    overstuffed backpack, a blue tote bag, a portable CD player case, and 
    several long tubes sticking out of a rather heavy-looking bag marked “Wall 
    stuff”. The redhead had just knocked on the door (because she had a free 
    hand), and since she was an author insertion, it didn’t knock like it would 
    for normal people, it nokked.<br/>
    <br/>
    They only had a few moments to wait before a harried-looking wisteria plant 
    wearing a rumpled track suit answered the door. <i>Yes?</i> it asked in an odd 
    noiseless voice. <i>If you’re selling something, we aren’t buying...</i> It noticed 
    the creature behind them, jumped back, and glared. <i>And a 
    Mini-Balrog...evildoers and friends of Cam! We will not give up any more 
    agents to her insanity! If you want applicants for OFUM, try Fanfiction.net.</i><br/>

    <br/>
    “Er, no,” said the redhead, Nenya, being the first to recover her wits. 
    “We’re here to apply for a job –”<br/>
    <br/>
    They never got a chance to finish. Two blue-flowered fronds shot out and 
    grabbed them, pulling them inside and slamming the door behind them. If 
    Glorfindal had not had the speed of a Mini, he would have been left behind. 
    The wisteria locked the door rather hurriedly. <i>Thank God!</i> it non-yelled. 
    <i>This way...</i><br/>
    <br/>
    The sisters found themselves being pulled along a long grey corridor. The 
    wisteria had curled its fronds around each of their wrists and was cutting 
    off the circulation to each hand.<br/>

    <br/>
    “Ow ow ow ow ow....you know, I’m, ow, not going to be much good as an agent, 
    ow, if I’m missing my right hand, ow!” Rosie tried to uncoil the frond from 
    her wrist.<br/>
    <br/>
    <i>Sorry,</i> the wisteria plant apologized briefly, but did not relent. He dragged 
    them through endless gray hallways until they came to...a wall.<br/>
    <br/>
    The wisteria let them go and stood there expectantly.<br/>

    <br/>
    The sisters looked at the wall, each other, and back at the wisteria plant.<br/>
    <br/>
    “It’s a wall,” Nenya said, earning her a high score in the Hall of Most 
    Obvious Statements.<br/>
    <br/>
    <i>Oh.</i> The wisteria looked ashamed. He quickly reached out and tapped a 
    meaningless pattern on the metal. Suddenly, the girls felt a shove from 
    behind, and they stumbled into a room whose walls were painted (surprise!) 
    gray. Glorfindal followed them in and stood over Nenya, his wings spread 
    protectively about her and Rosie. The door slid shut behind them.<br/>

    <br/>
    There was a desk in the center of the room, made of some sort of undefinable 
    gray metal. A swivelling chair was turned away from them.<br/>
    <br/>
    <i>New recruits?</i> The non-voice sounded almost excited. <i>Can it be?</i><br/>
    <br/>
    “Yes it can,” replied Nenya confidently. “We’re here to help you out.”<br/>

    <br/>
    <i>You sound remarkably sane.</i> The chair swivelled around, and they were met 
    face to blossom with the famed Sunflower Official, a bizarre-looking 
    sunflower in a gray suit. It tilted its head up to once-over Glorfindal, and 
    turned back to the two indifferently.<br/>
    <br/>
    “God, is everything in this place gray?” muttered Rosie.<br/>
    <br/>
    <i>I heard that. Well, my dears, come closer.</i><br/>

    <br/>
    The sisters exchanged a look, and warily approached the desk.<br/>
    <br/>
    Two fronds reached out and grabbed them by the chins. <i>Well, you’re 
    breathing. And you can speak. And you do not appear to possess any 
    flamethrowers.</i><br/>
    <br/>
    “Hee hee....fiiiire....” Rosie’s eyes got big.<br/>
    <br/>

    The SO raised a petal (eyebrow). <i>I shall choose to ignore that statement. 
    And that...thing, I assume, is tamed?</i><br/>
    <br/>
    “Yes,” Nenya replied proudly. “Glorfindal is very obedient and only cruel to 
    Mary Sues. He doesn’t eat much – raw eggs, bacon, and the odd fangirl.”<br/>
    <br/>
    Glorfindal tried not to drool – he hadn’t eaten in at least five hours, and 
    he was rather hungry. The mention of his favorite snack made his stomach 
    growl.<br/>
    <br/>
    <i>Good. And I see by your attire, that if your preferred genre is what I think 
    it is, that you are very dedicated and know your canon. Very good. Fill out 
    these forms, and you can start work today.</i> It threw a stack of papers at 
    them.<br/>

    <br/>
    “Yes, sir,” they replied obediently. They picked up random pens off the desk 
    and began scribbling away. Glorfindal amused himself by doing target 
    practice with his whip on some scattered papers tacked up on the wall of the SO’s 
    office. The SO looked a bit peeved, but allowed it to pass.<br/>
    <br/>
    All was quiet for a few moments, until –<br/>
    <br/>
    “Nenya?”<br/>
    <br/>

    “What?”<br/>
    <br/>
    “Am I sane?”<br/>
    <br/>
    “Compared to <a href="http://hikaness.deep-ice.com/">Hika</a>...yes. Compared to Mr. Tolkien...no.”<br/>
    <br/>

    “Ah.” Rosie began to scribble again. Then,<br/>
    <br/>
    “Nenya?”<br/>
    <br/>
    “What?”<br/>
    <br/>
    “What is our preferred area of work?”<br/>

    <br/>
    “Lord of the Rings. Any genre except slash.”<br/>
    <br/>
    “Ah.”<br/>
    <br/>
    After a few moments, they both finished at the same instant.<br/>
    <br/>

    They blinked.<br/>
    <br/>
    “Wow...that was a plot hole...” Rosie commented.<br/>
    <br/>
    <i>Those are abundant around here.</i> The SO snatched up their papers and 
    organized them in an instant. <i>Good, good, good...REALLY? you’re both an 8 on 
    the sanity test?!?!?!</i><br/>
    <br/>

    “Yes...”<br/>
    <br/>
    <i>YOU’RE HIRED!</i> The SO threw a pair of black uniforms at them with the symbol 
    of a spoon in a dish on the left sleeve. <i>Lord of the Rings. Multiple 
    Offenses department. We’ve only got two or three teams working there. We’ll 
    channel them so you don’t get any slash. The Mary Sues are abounding, 
    however. You’ll have quite a few of those. You’ll have to kill a lot...</i><br/>
    <br/>
    “Oh, we won’t have a problem with that,” Rosie said, a strange light behind 
    her eyes. Both the SO and Nenya subconsciously backed away.<br/>
    <br/>

    <i>Go. Go go go go. Change into these uniforms. The Head of Operations will 
    take you to your Response Center. Your Mini can stay with you, but he can’t 
    accompany you on missions...</i><br/>
    <br/>
    “The Head of Operations...is that the blue flowered thingy?” asked Rosie, 
    showing off her remarkable lack of scientific vocabulary.<br/>
    <br/>
    <i>The wisteria, yes.</i> The sunflower stamped each of them on the forehead with a 
    rubber thing that said “S.O. Aprroved”.<br/>
    <br/>

    “Er...you spelled approved wrong,” Rosie pointed out, looking at Nenya’s 
    forehead.<br/>
    <br/>
    <i>That’s because I’m special. Now get out of here.</i><br/>
    <br/>
    The sisters obeyed, still a bit dazed. They stumbled out the door and 
    followed the HoO into the ladies’ restroom, where they changed. Then they 
    were given instructions on how to get to their response center, and left to 
    survive on their own.<br/>
    <br/>
    They were still standing in the middle of the hall, dazed, rather 
    uncomfortable in their starchy black uniforms, with their Elven cloaks that 
    hadn’t settled down yet dancing around and refusing to be still, with 
    Glorfindal carrying all of their things, when Jay and Acacia happened by. 
    Jay and Acacia! If I were to tell you only a quarter of all I have heard 
    about them, and I only know a very little of all there is to know, you would 
    be prepared for any sort of remarkable tale. But enough with the corny 
    swiped lines.<br/>

    <br/>
    But of course, though Rosie and Nenya had heard of Jay and Acacia and all 
    their marvelous exploits, they didn’t recognize them, possibly because they 
    were still a little dazed...that and the fact that the two famous agents were disguised as a 
    pair of Uruk-Hai.<br/>
    <br/>
    “EEK!” the shorter (but still remarkably taller than either Nenya or Rosie) 
    Uruk squealed, grabbing the arm of the other. “JAYJAYJAY! NEWBIES! NEWBIES 
    WITH A MINI!”<br/>
    <br/>
    “Newbies? WHERE?” The other creature spun around and stared straight at 
    them. “YE GODS! IT IS! OHHH SWEET VICTORY!” They grabbed each other and 
    danced around in a circle, a rather strange sight with Uruk-Hai.<br/>
    <br/>

    Nenya and Rosie backed away slowly.<br/>
    <br/>
    “Acacia...”<br/>
    <br/>
    “Yes?”<br/>
    <br/>
    “We’re scaring them.” The taller one gestured to the frightened recruits.<br/>

    <br/>
    “Oh. Silly, Acacia, remember – scare everyone but new recruits.”<br/>
    <br/>
    Her partner patted her on the head. “Good girl.”<br/>
    <br/>
    “We’re terribly sorry about the disguises,” Acacia said, turning back to the 
    girls. “Our console screwed up, so we stayed in our disguises through one of 
    those free-floating plot holes. We’ll change back as soon as Makes-Things 
    fixes it.”<br/>
    <br/>

    “Ah.” The girls did not look much less frightened.<br/>
    <br/>
    Jay fixed her eyes on Glorfindal, and let out a shriek. “He’s so cuuuute!!! 
    Ooozagoodboyden! Oh, yes, you are! Yes, you are!” She threw her arms around 
    him.<br/>
    <br/>
    Glorfindal looked a bit taken aback. Nenya glared. “Glorfindal’s MINE, thank 
    you!” she growled, hauling Jay away from her precious Mini.<br/>
    <br/>
    All of a sudden there was a bang, and then a funny sizzling sound, and then 
    a pff (onomatopoeia stolen from the Harry Potter/LOTR crossover done by the 
    original PPC). The world flickered bizarrely before their eyes...<br/>

    <br/>
    ..and instead of two ugly Uruks in full war gear, they were suddenly faced 
    by a pair of young girls, younger than Nenya but older than Rosie. There was 
    a tall, gangly one with messy reddish hair and a shorter brunette wearing a 
    pair of glasses. They both looked like assassins-turned-friendly, the effect 
    rather disturbing.<br/>
    <br/>
    “Hi,” the taller one volunteered. “I’m Jay.”<br/>
    <br/>
    “I’m Acacia.” They both smiled and grabbed the girls’ hands and shook them 
    vigorously.<br/>
    <br/>

    “Ohhhh, right!” Rosie said all of a sudden. “The flake with the camera and 
    the bloodthirsty homicidal maniac! I’ve heard of you.”<br/>
    <br/>
    “That’s us,” Acacia replied with a smile. “Come on, we’ll take you to your 
    response centre!” She grabbed Rosie and yanked her down the hall. Jay and Nenya rode 
    on Glorfindal.<br/>
    <br/>
    Soon enough, they reached another grey metal door, this one with a knob. 
    Acacia threw it open and ushered the newbies inside. Jay reluctantly hopped 
    off Glorfindal’s back.<br/>
    <br/>
    “This is your response centre,” Acacia said proudly, gesturing to the room 
    around them. It was gray (wow, big surprise) and metal. There were a couple 
    of high-backed chairs next to a huge gray mainframe-computer-like machine 
    with a screen and a lot of interesting-looking buttons and knobs. A rather 
    tight uncomfortable-looking couch upholstered in scratchy gray material was 
    set at the other end of the room, and a few cupboards with large doors hung 
    on the walls. “Get used to it – you’ll live here until they decide to 
    liberate you.”<br/>

    <br/>
    Both new recruits looked rather frightened.<br/>
    <br/>
    Suddenly, a loud “beeeeeeeep” jolted through the air, not from the computer 
    in this response centre, but from a room down the hall. All four agents 
    jumped.<br/>
    <br/>
    “VERDAMMEN!” Jay yelled, and went running down the hall, Acacia following 
    her. Screams of “What the HECK?” and “I swear, they give us all the hardest 
    ones!” filtered through the gray metal door, and the sound of something 
    whacking against metal was followed by the crunching and electronic sizzle 
    of a computer being destroyed.<br/>
    <br/>

    A second later there was a cry of “A MONKEY?”<br/>
    <br/>
    Both newly-recruited agents decided they didn’t want to know.<br/>
    <br/>
    Nenya shut the door.<br/>
    <br/>
    Rosie looked at Nenya.<br/>

    <br/>
    Nenya looked at Rosie.<br/>
    <br/>
    “Posters?” Rosie ventured.<br/>
    <br/>
    “You can put them up. I have reading to do.”<br/>
    <br/>

    “Where are you?”<br/>
    <br/>
    “Eowyn and Faramir.”<br/>
    <br/>
    “Cool.”<br/>
    <br/>
<center><hr width="25%"></center>
    <br/>

    “These tears you cry...have come too late...take back the lies....the hurt, 
    the blame...” Rosie sang along with Gollum’s Song as she put up a large 
    poster of the Fellowship on the door of one of the cupboards. Glorfindal was 
    sprawled on the couch with Nenya sitting cross-legged in his lap, reading a 
    part from The Return of the King.<br/>
    <br/>
    A tear slipped out of Nenya’s eye. “Oh, Rowie, do you have to sing that?” 
    She wiped her eyes on her sleeve. “I’m gettig by uniforb all wet!”<br/>
    <br/>
    Rosie rolled her eyes. “Geez, you’re too sentimental for this job.” She 
    continued singing along with the song playing in her earphones. “And you 
    will weep when you face the end alone...you are lost, you can never go 
    home...”<br/>
    <br/>
    Nenya plugged her ears and began singing at the top of her lungs. “IF YOU 
    SLEEP, YOU SLEEP WITH GOD...AND IF I CRY, IT’S FOR MY HEART...”<br/>

    <br/>
    “AIIEEEE!!!!” Rose screeched. “Fine.” With the lightning speed that comes from 
    years of changing CD's in science class while your teacher’s back is turned, 
    she had her CD back in its case, stowed safely in her pack, and had the 
    Matrix soundtrack playing before Nenya had time to get past the third line. 
    “Du...du hast...du hast mich...” She lapsed into Rammstein from Gollum’s 
    Song remarkably quickly. She climbed down from her chair, dragged it 
    over to a designated spot above the console, and began tacking up a large 
    poster of Frodo with the Ring.<br/>
    <br/>
    <b>[BEEEEP!]</b><br/>
    <br/>
    “Hey, our first mission!” Rosie beamed. She stepped down from her chair and 
    pulled off her headphones, leaning towards the screen. “It better be 
    suitably bad...hmm....this isn’t THAT bad...but...OH NO!” She curled up in 
    the fetal position and began to rock back and forth. “The pain,” she 
    murmured.<br/>
    <br/>

    “What is it?” asked Nenya. “On second thought...maybe I don’t want to know.”<br/>
    <br/>
    “It’s a code 10, hair 27696,” Rosie whimpered. “Remember how you said that 
    those were usually the worst of all? Let me put it bluntly: THIS ONE IS! 
    It’s another of those second-daughter-of-Elrond fics – that should tell you 
    a lot – and ELROND DOESN’T KNOW ABOUT ARWEN AND ARAGORN.”<br/>
    <br/>
    “Oh Eru,” Nenya muttered. “Now HE, of all people...”<br/>
    <br/>
    “Exactly,” Rosie agreed as she climbed from her spot and went over to the 
    console. “What shall we be this time?”<br/>

    <br/>
    “Uhm...Orcs?”<br/>
    <br/>
    “Sure – oh, SHIESSE.”<br/>
    <br/>
    “What?”<br/>
    <br/>

    “We have to be Orcs,” Rosie said glumly. “We have to infiltrate their ranks 
    and RESCUE ARWEN EVENSTAR.”<br/>
    <br/>
    Nenya closed her eyes in exasperation.<br/>
    <br/>
    Rosie decided that no more words were needed. She reached over and tapped a 
    button on the console. A weird-looking oblongish 
    plot-hole-deus-ex-machina-type doorway appeared in midair.<br/>
    <br/>
    Rosie blinked. “Heeyyy...fun.” She grabbed her pack – containing just her CD 
    player, her CD collection, and her nifty new Canon Character Analysis 
    Device, provided by Makes-Things. Nenya had a Non-Canon CAD, designed to 
    tell who was a bit character and who was a Sue. They couldn’t wait to play 
    with them. Attached to the outside of Rosie's pack were a sleeping roll, a large Uruk-Hai 
bow, and several short thick black-feathered Uruk arrows in a leather quiver.  If you looked 
closely, you would see that one of them had a couple of Nenya’s hairs stuck under the 
arrow-head–on the off chance that they'd actually be hired at the PPC, Rosie had been practicing 
with her bow and arrows for the past week. She wasn't yet a perfect shot. Nenya had dodged, but 
her hair hadn't.<br/>

    <br/>
    They both stood before the portal, carrying their gear. There was an awkward 
    silence.<br/>
    <br/>
    “You first,” Rosie motioned for Nenya to use the portal first.<br/>
    <br/>
    “This was your idea.”<br/>
    <br/>

    “You’re the better fighter. If you fall into an orc-fight, you can defend 
    yourself better.”<br/>
    <br/>
    “Thanks a lot.”<br/>
    <br/>
    Finally, Rosie, being the foolhardy one, gulped, and all of a sudden leaped 
    through the portal and landed rather solidly on...<br/>
    <br/>
    ...a hobbit’s bedroll.<br/>

    <br/>
    Something moved under her. A head of curly, sandy hair popped out. A muffled 
    voice shouted “Hey!”<br/>
    <br/>
    “Wak!” Rosie hurriedly crawled off the bedroll. That’s when she noticed she 
    had landed on Sam.<br/>
    <br/>
    If Nenya had not arrived at that moment and pulled her swooning sister out of Sam’s line of vision, she would have been dead. As it was, Sam sat bolt 
    upright, yelling “Strider!”<br/>
    <br/>

    “Yes? What is it?” came a deep voice from their right. Nenya’s face lit up.<br/>
    <br/>
    Strider came crashing through the underbrush, looking manly, rugged, and 
    fully the King of Gondor in disguise. Nenya’s mouth dropped open.<br/>
    <br/>
    “Er, Nenya...it’s Strider...”<br/>
    <br/>
    “Gleep...” Nenya couldn’t keep her eyes off the ranger. 
    “He’s...so...smoking...hot...”<br/>

    <br/>
    Rosie was having similar feelings towards the scared hobbit in the bedroll. 
    Neither of them were focusing on the conversation at hand.<br/>
    <br/>
    Rosie snapped out of it when Sam turned away. “Nenya...er, Nen...was this 
    part of the story?”<br/>
    <br/>
    “No,” Nenya replied, turning a devilish smile on her. “But I figured neither 
    of us would mind.”<br/>
    <br/>

    “Aha.” Rosie grinned, the effect rather frightening on an Uruk-Hai.<br/>
    <br/>
    “Strider! An orc! It landed on me!”<br/>
    <br/>
    “What gripping dialogue...” Rosie said glumly. “SAM DESERVES BETTER THAN 
    THAT!”<br/>
    <br/>
    Nenya reached out and tapped a few buttons on some sort of electronic thing 
    in her pocket. The world snapped and fizzled and went pff (onomatopoeia 
    stolen from abovementioned crossover), and suddenly Sam was sleeping again, 
    and Strider was sitting on the side, smoking a pipe, humming something in 
    Elvish, looking thoughtful.<br/>

    <br/>
    “Ohhhh...” Nenya was out of it again.<br/>
    <br/>
    Suddenly one of the bedrolls (not Sam’s, to Rosie’s disappointment) stirred. 
    Frodo’s dark brown curls and (debatably) darling blue eyes popped out. He 
    watched Strider for a moment in silence, trying to comprehend the elvish 
    words.<br/>
    <br/>
    <i>Tinúviel elvanui Elleth alfirin ethelhael<br/>
    O hon ring finnil fuinui A renc gelebrin thiliol,</i><br/>

    Strider sang, confusing Frodo slightly, and sending Nenya into swoons of 
    ecstacy.<br/>
    <br/>
    “Who is she?” Frodo spoke up, looking up at Strider.<br/>
    <br/>
    Strider looked puzzled. Frodo elaborated. “This woman you sing of.”<br/>
    <br/>
    “He’s so hot when he’s puzzled...”<br/>

    <br/>
    “Mmmm....” Rosie replied dreamily. She was something of a Strider fangirl 
    herself, though her real loyalties lay with Sam.<br/>
    <br/>
    “Tis the Lay of Luthien. The Elf-maiden who gave her love to Beren, a 
    mortal,” Strider replied sadly.<br/>
    <br/>
    “Lay of LEITHIAN, damn you,” Rosie muttered to no one in particular. “If it 
    hadn’t been for certain things such as ‘lawsuit’, I’d be afraid they’d send 
    us to exorcize the movie one day.”<br/>
    <br/>

    “What happened to her?” asked Frodo curiously.<br/>
    <br/>
    Strider looked away. His face bore a hint of tears (at least according to 
    the FOTR SE DVD transcript). “She died.”<br/>
    <br/>
    Frodo looked surprised and sad. Strider turned back to him. “Get some sleep, 
    Frodo.”<br/>
    <br/>
    Frodo burrowed back under the covers and tried to sleep. Strider continued 
    looking thoughtful and humming, blissfully unaware of the pair of Uruk-Hai 
    standing there, ogling him.<br/>

    <br/>
    After a moment, Rosie got up and walked around to see what Sam looked like 
    when he was asleep, while Nenya crawled closer to Strider to inspect the 
    pipe he was smoking. She then nicked the extra one out of his pack and began 
    kissing it.<br/>
    <br/>
    Rosie was inspecting Sam’s frying pan. She was seriously considering 
    snitching it, until she remembered a few words, like “Movie-Verse” and “The 
    Frying Pan of DOOM”. She settled for inhaling the Samwise’s-cooking-smell 
    deeply, rubbing it all over a handkerchief, storing the handkerchief in a 
    plastic bag and placing it carefully it in her backpack, and regretfully 
    fastening the frying pan back to his pack.<br/>
    <br/>
    She crawled back to Nenya and tapped her on the shoulder. “Er, Nenya...”<br/>
    <br/>

    “Wha?” Nenya was in a daze because she thought she'd heard Strider sighing something 
to himself about liking red hair.<br/>
    <br/>
    “Don’t you think we ought to get going? I’m not exactly keen on the idea of 
    following a Ranger for two weeks weighted down with fifty pounds of Uruk-Hai 
    gear...”<br/>
    <br/>
    “Oh, yes, certainly.” Nenya sighed and regretfully bade the oblivious 
    Strider farewell. She was about to open a portal when she turned to Rosie 
    with a pleading look.<br/>
    <br/>
    Rosie sighed. “What now?”<br/>

    <br/>
    “Pleeeease can we see Strider at Weathertop?”<br/>
    <br/>
    Rosie brightened. “Sure!”<br/>
    <br/>
    Nenya entered the info into the activator. A moment later, a portal 
    flickered into existence. Through it could be heard the sound of Nazgul 
    screeching, and they both spied a single dark figure, sword drawn and 
    glinting in the light of the moon, running up the side of a hill, the top of 
    which had the remains of a tower on it.<br/>
    <br/>

    They looked at each other, grinned, and stepped through.<br/>
    <br/>
<center><hr width="25%"></center>
    <br/>
    Frodo was invisible. Five Black Riders stood over him, one with a sword 
    jabbed into Frodo’s invisible shoulder. The blood was visible, and the 
    effect was rather disconcerting.<br/>
    <br/>
    “Eww...” Rosie wrinkled her nose.<br/>
    <br/>

    All of a sudden, there was a Rangerish yell. Strider leapt into the 
    clearing, brandishing a fiery branch and a sword.<br/>
    <br/>
    Two invisible Uruks crumpled up in a dead faint.<br/>
    <br/>
    The dead faint, however, became a little less dead when a hobbit stepped on 
    Rosie’s stomach.<br/>
    <br/>
    “Oof,” Rosie mumbled. She woke just in time to see Strider clashing swords 
    with the third Nazgul.<br/>

    <br/>
    She awoke Nenya, and the two stared, openmouthed, as the Dunedan fought off 
    the five Wraiths singlehandedly.<br/>
    <br/>
    After it was over, they sighed resignedly and opened a portal to the OC’s 
    entrance into the story.<br/>
    <br/>
<center><hr width="25%"></center>
    <br/>
    “Laurel!” Arwen cried, running towards her sister, her dress flowing behind 
    her as she moved quickly over the wet ground, sparkling with morning dew.<br/>

    <br/>
    “Oh, God, NOT a ‘flowing dress’...” Rosie dropped her head into her 
    hands and fell to the ground.<br/>
    <br/>
    “Arwen’s sparkling with morning dew,” Nenya mused, as she studied the Elven 
    maid clad in a flowing gown that was covered with iridescent dew drops. 
    “That’s rather odd.”<br/>
    <br/>
    “At least it’s not the Mary Sue,” Rosie mumbled. “Thank God for small 
    favours.”<br/>
    <br/>

    Laurel looked up from her writing and saw her sister, Arwen. “Sister, is 
    someone hurt? Is father all right?” she asked, standing up.<br/>
    <br/>
    Rosie peeked at the writing pad the Sue had disregarded and read a few lines 
    of what she was writing. She began to cackle.<br/>
    <br/>
    “What?” asked Nenya warily.<br/>
    <br/>
    “These Sues are stupider than I thought. Look at her paper.”<br/>

    <br/>
    Nenya peered at the dropped writing-pad, careful not to let the OC notice 
    her. “‘Legolas is like, so hot and I’m like, so going to marry him when he 
    like, so totally falls, like, madly in love with my beauty and 
    perfectness...this story is, like, going perfectly!’ Oh Eru!”<br/>
    <br/>
    “Exactly.”<br/>
    <br/>
    Arwen took a deep breath, and spoke, her eyes glimmering. “Yes. Father is 
    fine. But, the fellowship will be arriving soon, with news.”<br/>
    <br/>

    “One for the charge list,” Rosie muttered. “Causing the Fellowship to ARRIVE 
    at Rivendell, already a group of Nine. In other words, sidetracking the 
    whole fircken Quest just to please their little Mary-Sue whims.”<br/>
    <br/>
    “It’s not that bad, yet,” Nenya allowed, watching curiously as the dew drops 
    all over Arwen began to run down to the ground, soaking her dress. Arwen 
    seemed not to notice.<br/>
    <br/>
    Rosie did not reply. She was too busy beating her head against a handy tree. 
    Nenya borrowed her Character Analysis Device, and held it towards Arwen.<br/>
    <br/>
    [Arwen Evenstar. Elf female. Canon. Out of Character 14.4%]<br/>

    <br/>
    “Well, that isn’t so bad,” Nenya ventured. Rosie just continued beating her 
    head against the trunk.<br/>
    <br/>
    Laurel nodded. Arwen practically danced. “Aragorn is coming. But, you 
    mustn’t let on to father about us.” Arwen said mindfully.<br/>
    <br/>
    BEEEEEEEEP!<br/>
    <br/>

    The younger elf looked up. “What was that?”<br/>
    <br/>
    “What was what, dear sister?”<br/>
    <br/>
    The beep became more shrill.<br/>
    <br/>
    “Shiesse!” Nenya hissed, fumbling for the mute on the device. She pressed it 
    just as the Sue began to get up. She ignored the next story lines as she tried to 
    read the text on the tiny screen.<br/>

    <br/>
    “How bad is it?” Rosie moaned.<br/>
    <br/>
    Nenya simply handed her the muted CAD.<br/>
    <br/>
    [68.41 CHARACTER RUPTURE!] the screen flashed. Even with the mute on, it 
    still was forced to let out a tiny bip...bip...bip at the horribleness of 
    the scene.<br/>
    <br/>

    Rosie rolled her eyes and stashed it back in her pack. “This is really, 
    really bad. I mean really.”<br/>
    <br/>
    They both, unfortunately, remembered their duty just in time to see Laurel 
    (gag) wandering by on the path that was lit by “eerily romantic” light, 
    humming a truly awful lullaby.<br/>
    <br/>
    “Oh, ye gentle prince, upon the shore, come bring to me your wondrous gift. 
    Of simple rose and spring’s soft dew, captured skillfully on the ivy.” she 
    sang in her (VERY debatably [it sounded like a hoarse cow trying to imitate 
    Brittany Spears]) melodic voice.<br/>
    <br/>
    Nenya was quietly sick in a bush, while Rosie rocked back and forth 
    muttering “Sam will save me, Sam will save me” to herself.<br/>

    <br/>
    “Celebrian would never sing something that horrible,” Nenya muttered weakly. 
    “But then again, Celebrian would never fall in love with –”<br/>
    <br/>
    Rosie stopped her. “I really, really don’t want to know...”<br/>
    <br/>
    “No, you’re right, you don’t. Never mind.”<br/>
    <br/>

    Rosie pulled a pad of paper out of a plot hole and began scribbling. 
    “Writing really bad songs and blaming it on Celebrian...being a second 
    daughter of Elrond...what else have we missed?”<br/>
    <br/>
    “Causing noble, honourable Elf-ladies to behave like human teenagers with a 
    crush....oh, and causing Aragorn and Arwen to have a secret love affair.”<br/>
    <br/>
    “Yes...YES.” Rosie nodded approvingly. Her pencil scribbled across the 
    yellow legal sheet.<br/>
    <br/>
    “What a beautiful voice you have. May I ask your name?” A voice interrupted 
    the Mary Sue’s song, to the extreme relief of the PPC agents.<br/>

    <br/>
    Laurel turned around quickly. She saw a man standing there. He had silvery 
    hair, the color of the moon, and from what she could make out deep blue 
    eyes. He stood tall, with a regal pose, and soft elfin features.<br/>
    <br/>
    Both agents heard a rrrip, as if in a heavy fabric.<br/>
    <br/>
    “What’s that?” asked Rosie, turning around.<br/>
    <br/>

    “Just a major rip in canon,” Nenya replied, studying her Device. “New 
    Mini-Race. Thousands of half-sized Balrogs trying to get through the curtain 
    of bad-writingness to get to Cam.”<br/>
    <br/>
    Rosie moaned. “Elfin? ELFIN?”<br/>
    <br/>
    “Not to nitpick,” Nenya added, while rifling through the contents of her 
    backpack for her CD player to numb the pain, “but Legolas is not a man, and 
    being a daughter of Elrond, she should know that.”<br/>
    <br/>
    “Charge list!” Rosie hurriedly pulled out the yellow pad and scribbled. 
    “Charges D9 and E2!” Rosie had made it her business to know the Official 
    Charge List off by heart.<br/>

    <br/>
    “Whatever,” Nenya mumbled, pulling out a CD player. “Shiesse! Neither Lianna 
    Klassen nor Enya are loud enough to drown this out...do you have any harder 
    stuff?”<br/>
    <br/>
    “Uhh, I’ve got...Creed, Rammstein, Our Lady Peace, Delirious and Avril 
    Lavigne,” Rosie replied, rummaging through her things.<br/>
    <br/>
    “Gimme,” Nenya ordered, holding out her hand, not really caring which band 
    she got. Rosie handed over Weathered.<br/>
    <br/>

    “Wait, one of us has to take notes,” Rosie protested, as Nenya jammed on her 
    headphones.<br/>
    <br/>
    “Can you do it? I’ll take the banquet...”<br/>
    <br/>
    Rosie scanned the Words. “Okay...but you have to take the walk with Legolas 
    in the morning, because the walk in the garden is exceedingly painful...”<br/>
    <br/>
    “Fine by me.” Nenya was already lost in Bullets. Rosie suspected that if her 
    sister had bothered to check the words, she would not have agreed so easily. 
    But there were reasons why Rosie had considered her alternate personality as 
    a candidate for the Ultimate Evil.<br/>

    <br/>
    Rosie turned back to the story, pen and legal pad in hand and ready for 
    battle – to find out that through a cruel and unsummoned plot hole, she had 
    missed nothing through her dragged-out-in-hope-of-missing-the-painful-parts 
    discussion with Nenya.<br/>
    <br/>
    “My name, sir, is Laurel, daughter of Lord Elrond, sister of Arwen.” Laurel 
    replied, bowing shortly. “May, I have yours?”<br/>
    <br/>
    “Legolas Greenleaf.” he said, bowing too. Laurel smiled slightly. “Are you 
    part of the fellowship?”<br/>
    <br/>

    Rosie groaned. Several charges came to mind, and she began to scribble 
    furiously.<br/>
    <br/>
    She scanned the Words up to where Nenya was supposed to take over. It seemed 
    excruciatingly painful, and there weren’t enough charges to have to be there 
    as they happened. Rosie hurriedly scribbled down a few charges, such as 
    charge C 1.3 and Making Greenleaf a Last Name, and then pulled out a 
    Discman, a pair of earphones and the treasured Human Clay.<br/>
    <br/>
    When she could almost feel the spare litmus paper in her pocket turn red, 
    she took them off and listened.<br/>
    <br/>
    “When I was born, it was prophesied that I would contain a secret. A secret 
    that only the one who truly loves me can reveal. No one knows what this 
    secret it, but they know this curse. It’s a curse of the Heart, I believe. 
    It’s very rare, and when the secret is revealed, it overcomes the bearer 
    until it is fulfilled. If it’s not fulfilled by a set date, the carrier of 
    it dies, and evil succumbs the world for one thousand years. The reason you 
    have never heard of me, is because my father fears for my life. He fears the 
    prophesy and has kept me under strict surveillance until now.” Laurel 
    finished.<br/>

    <br/>
    Ah, the cruelty of life and Laws. “At least she has a decent, albeit 
    fairy-tale-ish and deus-ex-machinic, excuse for never being mentioned in 
    canon,” Rosie murmured, wishing with all her heart that she had made Nenya 
    take this part. “So who cast this curse in the first place, anyway? And why 
    is she telling this random Elf, who she knows nothing about, everything 
    about her deepest darkest secret?” She started humming Army of Love to take 
    away some of the pain.<br/>
    <br/>
    Legolas stared at her for a moment, not knowing what to say. “A few chosen 
    people know of this, but as it comes into existence, more will know.” she 
    continued.<br/>
    <br/>
    <i>“We are not the enemy, we are here to–</i>oh, bloody hell. This cannot be this 
    bad....”<br/>
    <br/>

    “How did you come to get this secret?” Legolas asked, sitting down on a 
    stone wall, next to a garden of peonies.<br/>
    <br/>
    “My mother’s side of the family is said to be part enchantress, part fairy 
    and part elf. Something when this sort of blood is mixed, it causes a curse 
    of this.”<br/>
    <br/>
    “It’s this bad,” Rosie groaned. She began methodically beating her head 
    against the stone wall on which Legolas was seated. Luckily, the Elf was too 
    taken by the Sue’s magical enchanting I’m-so-beautiful-I-strike-you-dumb 
    powers to notice.<br/>
    <br/>
    “But why not to Arwen. Why you?” he asked.<br/>

    <br/>
    “Arwen is perfect. I would never wish something such as this upon her. But, 
    since you ask, I have no idea. I do not think anyone will ever know. It’s 
    like why do I have brown hair instead of blue or green. And why do I have 
    golden hair instead of brown, fiery orange or sable? Simply, because it just 
    is.” Laurel finished.<br/>
    <br/>
    “I wonder,” the PPC agent muttered, squinting and trying to make sense of 
    that paragraph. “Brown hair instead of blue or green...golden hair instead 
    of brown...am I the only one that confuses? Or maybe her hair’s changing 
    colour as she goes...and, by God, don’t insult us golden-heads!” Rosie 
    absently twirled a strand of her own frizzy golden-brown locks (which looked 
    quite out-of-place on a dark-skinned ugly creature) around a warped Orc 
    finger.<br/>
    <br/>
    She glanced ahead a little bit, and winced. She poked Nenya, who had fallen 
into a bit of a doze. “This is your 
    ballgame, Nen, I need some sleep. Gimme the CD, I need something to wash my 
    brain out with.”<br/>
    <br/>

    Nenya woke up after a few jostles. As the redhead was a heavy sleeper, Rosie had 
    to take off her sister’s earphones and practically yell into her ear to 
    get her on her feet.<br/>
    <br/>
    Before hauling off to the woods to set up her sleeping roll, Rosie glanced 
    ahead in the Words, as was her habit. She mumbled something about ‘shut off 
    the volume, it’s an Aragorn sex-change,’ and headed out.<br/>
    <br/>
    Nenya rolled her eyes and trailed after the Suvian and her Elven prey, 
    humming the dreaded If You Sleep just because Rosie wasn’t around. Then she 
    glanced up...and blinked...and blinked again. The Mary Sue was trying to 
    ‘cast her eyes over her retreat’. With another glance at the words, it 
    appeared she was also trying to create a painting inside her head, while 
    Legolas attempted to see himself in spoken words...The effect was a 
    maddening swirl of words in a paisley pattern.<br/>
    <br/>
    Nenya shook herself to clear her head, and ignored the next few lines as she 
    fished for silly putty in her bag. Silly putty was Nenya and Rosie’s 
    official means of sanity; it worked very well when one was tense, impatient, 
    or just plain ticked. The redhead began methodically working it over in her 
    hands as she hung out inconspicuously in a corner of the great banquet hall 
    that had suddenly appeared in the Last Homely House. Perhaps it was the Hall 
    of Fire, but it was neither dark nor particularly song-and-poem-like, and 
    there was no fireplace.<br/>

    <br/>
    Out came the charge list.<br/>
    <br/>
    A sudden break of tension signified the Sue breaking company with Legolas; 
    suddenly, the inexplicably golden-haired Elf was momentarily released from 
    bondage as Laurel abandoned him to go and speak with her father (who looked 
    pained at having to deal with another unexplained second daughter) and ‘Lord 
    Aragorn’ (who looked wary of this strange new menace). He wandered away, 
    dazed. Nenya, feeling for him, gave him a pat on the head and a whispered 
    assurance that it would be all right. He relaxed. Unfortunately, he was 
    called on again presently, to talk about random boring things with Elrond as 
    the Mary Sue displayed her patience and endurance as she listened politely.<br/>
    <br/>
    “Lord Elrond.” Legolas was saying, giving the Elf a stiff bow (as he was 
    very well aware it was not needed). “Lady Laurel.”<br/>
    <br/>

    Laurel nodded back, and affixed a serene smile to her face. She watched as 
    her father and Legolas talked. She stood quiet, and did not show her boredom 
    as she had been taught to.<br/>
    <br/>
    “And did not show her boredom...as she had been taught to...she had been 
    taught to show her boredom?” Nenya started giggling madly, thanking God that 
    Jay wasn’t here to see Elrond being depicted as such a teacher.<br/>
    <br/>
    As nothing interesting was happening for an undefined amount of time, Nenya 
    aimlessly scanned the room for any elves she would happen to know...<br/>
    <br/>
    ..and laid eyes upon a magnificent golden-haired grey-eyed Elf, standing in 
    the corner and speaking with some friends, completely unaware of any Suvian 
    influence beyond the regular distortion the presence of a badly done OC adds 
    to the environment.<br/>

    <br/>
    Glorfindel.<br/>
    <br/>
    Nenya’s heart nearly stopped. The Elven warrior was her reason for being 
    accepted to SNAOL. Her Mini-Balrog was named for him. He truly was a great 
    Elf...If only she had more time to speak to him. Perhaps, next mission, if 
    she pushed for Elven disguises...<br/>
    <br/>
    An ear-piercing shriek roused the hall and nearly split the PPC agent’s 
    eardrums. A perfectly-manicured finger pointed at Nenya, and a gratuitous 
    daughter of Lord Peredhel screeched “THERE’S AN ORC IN THE HALL!”<br/>
    <br/>

    “Bloody hell!” Nenya cried, dashing for the exit before she was seen. <i>Bad 
    Nenya!</i> her rational mind yelled. <i>You know Upstairs frowns on drooling...And 
    NOW look where it got you!</i><br/>
    <br/>
    She managed to make it outside the doors before they caught her, utilizing a 
    handy plot-hole that she’d found near the Sue. So, as the Elves rushed past 
    her searching for the mysterious Orc, no one noticed her, even though she 
    was calmly leaning against the side of the building.<br/>
    <br/>
    The Sue, of course, stayed inside and directed things. When no orc was 
    found, every Elf suddenly was returned to their proper place, and the story 
    carried on as it had before.<br/>

    <br/>
    In a few seconds, Nenya had to hide herself in the bushes and take notes as 
    Arwen and her pseudo-sister giggled together like a couple of teenagers. All 
    of a sudden, through a quirk of description, the very darkness rustled.<br/>
    <br/>
    Very abruptly, the scene shifted from a nighttime outdoors to mid-day in an 
    Elven bedchamber.<br/>
    <br/>
    Nenya blinked. The change was so sudden, she had to cover her eyes for about 
    five minutes until they would adjust to the bright sunlight shining through 
    the windows.<br/>
    <br/>

    “Wha-hop?” Rosie asked sleepily, yawning as she came up behind her sister, 
    the quick transportation a result of their last remaining available plothole.<br/>
    <br/>
    “Good morning. Darnit, Rosie, that was our last plothole! The Sue just heard 
    a rustling and suddenly it changed to day, for no real reason whatsoever,” 
    Nenya replied, firing off three different topics in the same sentence with 
    practiced ease.<br/>
    <br/>
    “Thank you. Sorry, I needed it. You know I can’t think in the mornings. 
    Lovely, now she’s interrupted a nice dream about Sam. May I have the honour 
    of murdering her?” Rosie yawned, replying in kind.<br/>
    <br/>
    “Be my guest...I’m not one for blood.”<br/>

    <br/>
    Rosie made a strange face. “Neither am I. Only the blood of Sues, especially 
    ones after Legolas.” Rosie had been a Legoluster once upon a time, and old 
    habits are hard to break.<br/>
    <br/>
    They both turned their attention to the scene, just in time to see the Sue 
    wake up from a long fitful sleep to see Elrond suddenly appear by her bed, 
    where he had apparently been ‘anxiously pacing’ for some time. Rosie 
    suspected he didn’t want to have any more to do with this Sue than he had 
    to, and had made use of a plothole she’d left behind.<br/>
    <br/>
    “Laurel, my daughter. You’re awake.” Elrond said. “You’ve been asleep for 
    only one day, but I was worried.”<br/>
    <br/>

    Laurel smiled slightly. “I’m all right, father. Is Arwen not with you?”<br/>
    <br/>
    Nenya rolled her eyes. “I don’t think Arwen’s gained invisibility powers in 
    the last day...”<br/>
    <br/>
    Elrond was silent for a long time. “Arwen, was taken.” He finally said.<br/>
    <br/>
    “Taken! Where?” Laurel cried, sitting up.<br/>

    <br/>
    “Calm yourself, daughter. She was taken to Isengard.” Elrond said.<br/>
    <br/>
    Nenya glanced at the Words, and grimaced. “You were right. Arwen’s been 
    ‘kidnaped’, apparently with no one noticing, not even our ever-alert Sue. 
    And apparently, for some unknown reason, they ignored her and just took 
    Arwen...”<br/>
    <br/>
    Rosie winced. “Brace yourself, here comes the .2 seconds in which she speeds 
    ahead two and a half days...”<br/>
    <br/>

    Nenya grabbed ahold of the nearest delicately-carved pillar.<br/>
    <br/>
    “Get your rest. You’ll need it.” He said, then left, closing the door behind 
    him.<br/>
    <br/>
    Suddenly, with a glittery pink asterisk and a nauseating time-separator, the 
    room gave a spine-tingling jolt, threw both of the agents across the room, 
    and then settled calmly back in place. The Sue, of course, remained 
    unaffected.<br/>
    <br/>
    “Ow...” Rosie groaned, as she pushed herself up. “Dammit. Put down some 
    Temporal-Spatial distortions, would you? Try charge B 1.”<br/>

    <br/>
    Nenya obediently got out the charge list from her position half-suspended about four 
feet off the floor in the arms of a large decorative candelabra. The redhead was gifted 
with the ability to read or write in any position at any time, something Rosie greatly envied.<br/>
    <br/>
    Then the blonde was forced to make a dive for cover under the Sue’s divan as 
    she realized that they were no longer hidden. Had a second more passed, and 
    had Rosie a fraction less of the instincts of being raised in a family of 
    six children, she would have been seen. Nenya, however, was pretty much 
    hooped.<br/>
    <br/>
    Luckily, Laurel didn’t notice her right away, and she had time to slip down 
    and join Rosie under the Elven bed. “That was close,” she whispered to her 
    sister. “And you aren’t really blonde, you know. There’s more brown than 
    there is blonde.”<br/>
    <br/>

    “Quit reading the narration, it’s annoying,” Rosie replied. “And it sounds 
    better to say ‘blonde’ than it does to say ‘golden-brown-haired person’.”<br/>
    <br/>
    “Golden hair is very Suvian. Wouldn’t it be easier to call you a brunette?”<br/>
    <br/>
    “So is red hair,” Rosie pointed out. “And I don’t like that word, brunette. 
    Sounds like some sort of fish-catching device.”<br/>
    <br/>
    Nenya looked at the words and groaned. “Can I tune out for a bit, Roslyn? 
    This is nauseating...”<br/>

    <br/>
    Rosie glared at her. “No. You promised, remember?”<br/>
    <br/>
    Nenya rolled her eyes. “Fine.” She clutched the charge list and handed Rosie 
    her pack. Then they both grabbed ahold of the passing plot hole that Laurel 
    had used to get out to the garden in a matter of nanoseconds, and were 
    pulled out over Rivendell and dropped about five metres away from the Sue.<br/>
    <br/>
    Both managed to land so as not to attract attention, and then Rosie pulled 
    out her CD player and two custom CDs their brother had burned for her. She 
    slipped in the first and tuned into Jesus Freak. “Separated, I cut myself 
    clean,” she started humming.<br/>
    <br/>

    Nenya left her oblivious sister sitting in the midst of an Elven paradise 
    (there WERE perks to this job), and singing rather off-key, and followed the 
    wandering Laurel around, plugging her ears so she wouldn’t have to listen to 
    the ‘random poems’ the Sue made up.<br/>
    <br/>
    Suddenly, with no warning at all, Legolas appeared randomly at her side, and 
    delivered his line “Good evening, again,” with a glazed look in his eye. 
    Nenya winced in sympathy.<br/>
    <br/>
    Laurel whirled around to face Legolas. “You, sir, have a habit of following 
    me, don’t you.” She said, a smile tugging at her lips.<br/>
    <br/>
    Legolas shrugged. “It could be that we just happen to be at the same place, 
    at the same time.”<br/>

    <br/>
    Nenya looked around for a handy wall, found none, and settled for beating 
    herself over the head with her Official Handbook. She continued in this 
    manner until finally, the Laws of Narrative Comedy decided to take pity on 
    her and ended the scene early.<br/>
    <br/>
    “Hey! Unfair!” Rosie protested, hoisting herself up from her comfortable 
    seat. “How come the Laws didn’t do that for me?”<br/>
    <br/>
    “I’m *special*.” Nenya stuck her tongue out rather childishly. “Besides, I 
    read the scene in advance and documented all charges.”<br/>
    <br/>

    Rosie glared. “Fine. So, can we kill her now?”<br/>
    <br/>
    “Let’s wait till she sidetracks the whole Quest AND invites herself along.”<br/>
    <br/>
    “She’s already done that...” Rosie fingered her crossbow anxiously. She 
    wanted blood.<br/>
    <br/>
    “No, Ros.”<br/>

    <br/>
    Rosie grumped. “Okay, okay.” Temporal distortions always put the 
    precision-loving Rosie in a bad mood. “And we can skip the very painful talk 
    with Elrond. We can get her as soon as she sets out – she’ll be alone and 
    unprotected. Except for ‘light Elfin armour’, which, since it’s 
    non-canonical and not Elven armour, should be easy to shoot through.”<br/>
    <br/>
    “What about her bow, ‘bundle of arrows’ and sword?”<br/>
    <br/>
    “I’ll sneak in and –” Rosie paused, considering her own remarkable lack of 
    grace. “On second thought, you sneak in, handcuff her and hold her, and I’ll 
    charge and shoot her.”<br/>
    <br/>

    “Fine by me.”<br/>
    <br/>
    Rosie hoisted her pack higher on her back. “Lessgo.”<br/>
    <br/>
    They reached the spot on the road just out of Rivendell by way of portal, 
    just as the Sue was approaching on horseback. Rosie cursed silently – she 
    hadn’t been counting on a horse.<br/>
    <br/>
    Nenya just hid behind a rock and waited. Rosie shrugged and did likewise.<br/>

    <br/>
    As the Sue clipped past on her horse, she suddenly sensed some sort of enemy 
    presence. Stupidly, instead of riding away, she dismounted and looked around 
    for it.<br/>
    <br/>
    Nenya took this opportunity to leap out, grab her by the wrists and hold her 
    down with one hand while she searched for the handcuffs with the other. The 
    horse very wisely bolted.<br/>
    <br/>
    “What are you doing?” she screeched, trying to wrestle free. “Let me go!”<br/>
    <br/>

    Nenya just clipped the handcuffs on and held the girl in place. “Rosie,” she 
    called. “It’s your cue.”<br/>
    <br/>
    “You’ve got no right to do this to me!” Laurel squealed, throwing a typical 
    Suvian tantrum. “I’m a daughter of Lord Elrond! I’m a princess of 
    Rivendell!”<br/>
    <br/>
    “Like hell you are,” Rosie said calmly, stepping out from behind a clump of 
    trees to the right of the path. “My dear, Elrond has a total of one 
    daughters, and if you think that we can let you force your way into this 
    wonderful family, you’ve got another think coming. I’ve got some charges for 
    you.” She pulled out the charge list, which was rather long indeed.<br/>
    <br/>
    “But you can’t do this!” she wailed. “Everything was going perfectly until 
    you showed up! Oh, Leggy, my Leggles, saaaaaave me!”<br/>

    <br/>
    “Shut up,” Nenya replied calmly. “Rosie?”<br/>
    <br/>
    Rosie cleared her throat and adjusted her spectacles. “Ahem. Laurel (Kudos 
    to you for having  only one short, bearable and almost Elvish name), you are 
    charged with *deep breath* Being a second daughter of Elrond, writing really 
    bad songs and blaming it on Celebrian, causing Aragorn and Arwen to have a 
    secret love affair, causing noble, placid Elf-ladies to behave like a human 
    teenager with a crush, having a voice like a sick cow imitating Brittany 
    Spears and making Legolas call it beautiful, doing away with Elladan and 
    Elrohir, covering Arwen in dewdrops (Quit glaring, Nenya, it’s a charge! 
    *deep breath*), charge D 9 – causing an original character to have an 
    unbearably beautiful voice, charge E 2 – displaying extreme stupidity, 
    forgetting to separate your paragraphs, saying things that make absolutely 
    no sense whatsoever, making Greenleaf a last name, charge C 1.3 – creating 
    non-canonical races such as fairies and enchantresses, having contradictory 
    hair, replacing the Hall of Fire with some strange banquet hall, charge A 
    1.4 – causing a character to act like a lovestruck fool, especially over an 
    original character, charge B 1 – Causing time compression, *breath* And, 
    last but not least, charge E 1 – REALLY annoying PPC agents.*” Rosie glared, 
    stepped back, and drew her crossbow.<br/>
    <br/>
    “What are you do –”<br/>
    <br/>

    *tzzing*<br/>
    <br/>
    *thunk*<br/>
    <br/>
    Rosie walked forward and pulled the arrow out of the Sue’s forehead. 
    Remarkably, Sues didn’t bleed when killed; they only let off small puffs of 
    glitter. Rosie examined the arrow, and stowed it in her pack for a souvenir, 
    as the first Sue she had ever killed.<br/>
    <br/>
    Nenya slung the body over her shoulder. “What should we do with her?”<br/>

    <br/>
    Rosie thought a moment. “I always heard that the Cats of Queen Beruthiel 
    were rather vicious when around spawns of the Enemy.”<br/>
    <br/>
    Nenya smiled rather evilly. “Yes. Portal?”<br/>
    <br/>
    The blonde pulled out a generator and tapped in the coordinates, and watched 
    bemusedly as Nenya dragged the dead willowy character with confusing hair 
    through the oblong door. She then followed, and the two watched 
    satisfactorily as a group of clawed felines ate their dinner.<br/>
    <br/>

    Then Rosie borrowed the generator and created a portal back to Headquarters. 
    The two stepped through, and felt that rippling change of form that always 
    happened when you changed from one being to another. Instead of two Uruk-Hai 
    standing there, there were two sisters in Elven cloaks carrying backpacks.<br/>
    <br/>
    There was an excited “Grrraarrr!” from the corner, and Glorfindal leaped out 
    and hugged them both tightly.<br/>
    <br/>
    They grinned at each other, and, just as if they were veteran agents back from their hundredth 
mission, dropped their things on the floor, flopped onto the couch 
    and went to sleep.<br/>
    <br/>
    Unfortunately, the computer refused to leave them alone.<br/>

    <br/>
    <b>BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP!</b><br/>
    <br/>
    “Utumno agar tummen!”<br/>
    <br/>

    <br/>
    <b>Rosie’s A/N:</b> Well, it’s finally done! Nenya’s been on my back to finish 
    this ever since she finished her chapter and posted it. I’d been putting it 
    off; however, adding Luxury, Jay and Acacia to my MSN list and actually 
    getting to *talk* to the heroines inspired me greatly, besides the fact that 
    they hinted at a new chapter coming out soon. Happiness is oh so wonderful!<br/>

    <br/>
    Oh, and the fact that Nenya’s coming home in two weeks helped too! :D I am 
    ecstatic. The only reason I’m not bouncing off the walls is because I 
    haven’t eaten any sugar in the last week, specifically to keep myself calm.<br/>
    <br/>
    Oh, and ‘Utumno agar tummen’ means ‘bloody hell!’ in Elvish. :D<br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <b>Nenya's A/N:</b> Rosie wrote most of this chapter, and I just helped with beta-reading
and real-life inspiration. If you count general insanity and nagging as 'inspiration'. Actually, 
I've been more active in supporting other PPC authors than in writing, these last few weeks. But
I hope you enjoy our latest chapter. There shall be more to come! And in case you haven't noticed, 
Rosie's taken up Creative Invective 101, which includes a lot of Elvish swearing. Sigh. And I thought
she had <i>innocent</i> reasons for wanting to learn Elvish....!
