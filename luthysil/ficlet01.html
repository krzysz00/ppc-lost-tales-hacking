<div class="box-content">

<p>One evening, before she started PPCing, Luthy was at home alone.</p>    

<p>She was reading some pretty terrible fanfic. One particularly sordid Legolas/Aragorn slash kept referring to Eldarion as “Eldraion”.</p>     

<p>This pained Luthy’s eyes, but then, so did the rest of the fic, so she ignored it.</p>     

<p>The next morning, when Luthy awoke, she heard some screaming and giggling outside her window.</p>     

<p>She went outside, curiously, to see what a bunch of giggly teenage girls were doing below her window.</p>    

<p>They were poking at a little creature which appeared to be on fire.</p>     

<p>“Awwwww, itz so cute!!!!!!!111 lets name it LEgolas!!!!!!!!11111111” one of them exclaimed.</p>     

<p>“okay!!!!111111” said one of the others.</p>

<p>“My Leggy!!”</p>   

<p>“no, miiinnee!!11”</p>  

<p>“Miiiinnee!!!”</p>  

<p>“Leggyy, marry meee!!”</p>

<p>And then the little fellow started roaring.</p>

<p>“ROAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! *fire*” he said.</p>    

<p>“AAAAAAAAAH!!!!!!!!!!!!!1111111” screamed two of the Sues.</p>

<p>“ack! leggy’s on fire!!!!!!!!11111” cried three more.</p>   

<p>“What are you doing to that poor mini-Balrog?” Luthy cried in dismay.</p>    

<p>“AHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!11111111 a evil being from beyond the abiss!!!11111111” said one Sue, and they all ran.</p> 

<p>“Awwwww,” said Luthy. “Poor little guy. They were tormenting you weren’t they? I’ve got some raw bacon if you’d like it…”</p>     

<p>He gave a pitiful little roar and then crawled over to her. He was clearly emotionally damaged.</p>

<p>What’s your name, little guy?” she asked, but got no response. “Oh, I bet you’re Eldraion from last night, aren’t you? I’m so sorry the Sues got to you!”</p>

<p>He mewled pitifully.</p>

<p>And that was how Luthy got her mini.</p>

<p>[A/N: That was so much fun to write, simply because it’s so terrible. Sil can tell you I died laughing a dozen times doing it. Fun!]</p>
