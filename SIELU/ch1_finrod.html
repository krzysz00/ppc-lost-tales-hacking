Don’t come in!”</span></b><span style="font-size:14"> written in hasty handwriting appeared near the exit out of the Mary Sue Department.&nbsp; Behind that door, in an inner room, a bored agent waited for her first assignment.&nbsp; <br><br>She was a new agent in the newly created subdivision for Elven affairs.&nbsp; She was a recent graduate of Elven Languages And Culture program at OFUM and recruit of PPC, signed up as Agent Lambda.&nbsp; She was longingly looking at the console and meanwhile trying to think what the abbreviation SIELU could mean.&nbsp; Special Interdepartmental Elven Linguistics Unit?&nbsp; Special Interdepartmental Elven Life Unit? Special Interdepartmental Elf-Lovers Unit? <br> <br>She started to dose off in her large, comfortable armchair, when console beeped.<br></span><b><span style="font-size:14"><br>[BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP!]</span></b><span style="font-size:14"><br><br>“Why does it beep exactly when I am falling asleep?&nbsp; As if it couldn’t beep when I was begging it to do so!” she muttered.<br></span><b><span style="font-size:14"><br>[BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP!]</span></b><span style="font-size:14"> was her only reply, but it seemed that this time there were hints of laughter in it.&nbsp; Evil, sarcastic joy.<br><br>She jumped up to it, not because she was in a hurry, but because the floor was covered with papers.&nbsp; She just moved in and she had no time yet to arrange her collection of Quenya compositions in the massive bookcases lining the walls.&nbsp; <br><br>“Oh no.&nbsp; How DARES she defile the sacred names of Finrod and Lúthien?!&nbsp; And mutilate beautiful Elven languages so!”<br><br>She was ready to open the portal right away, forgetting about weapons and disguises, but it was not for nothing she was sent to this unit and not to the Mary Sue Department proper, which desperately needed people.&nbsp; She could calm down quickly, and it was essential here.&nbsp; At SIELU the author had to receive a fair warning and offer of help before his or her creation could be destroyed.&nbsp; Lambda hoped that this author will NOT want to improve.&nbsp; After all, she had been told at the PPC training session that Suvians rarely reform.<br><br>She quickly compiled the charge list of all the author’s crimes and sent it using the PPC’s own mailing system, which delivered it immediately to the author (dropping the papers right at her head).&nbsp; The reply came soon.&nbsp; The Sue did not want to reform.<br><br>“Let the fun begin!” grinned Agent Lambda, and stepped to the console.&nbsp; Her only regret was that she did not get a partner.&nbsp; The whole new unit consisted of Unit Head, The Poison Ivy in bright pink dress, and herself.<br><br>She chose the guise of a Noldorin Elf, black-haired, grey-eyed, and pale; took the bag with the Two-in-One Character Analysis Device; an immobilizing pistol stolen from a local zoo right before she had left the Real World; a nerve agent mixed by herself (pharmacy school finally paying off); and stepped in.&nbsp; Even then, she was sure she was forgetting something important.&nbsp; After all, it was her first mission.<br><br>***<br><br>Lambda found herself in a strange generic forest, where trees were constantly changing shape – pines turned into rowans, birches into oaks, ashes into firs.&nbsp; It made her head spin, and she regretted not taking Dramamine with her.&nbsp; <br><br>“Note to self:&nbsp; bring anti-nausea medications when traveling through generic areas.”<br><br>The worst thing was that there was a strange noise, like a song of nightingale as large as a blue whale, coming from all sides.&nbsp; She looked at the Words and sighed.&nbsp; Tinúviel forest.&nbsp; A forest which tries to sing like a nightingale.&nbsp; <br><br>“And I can’t even bring earplugs with me.&nbsp; Now I know why the ad specified that they need a calm person with strong nervous system and endless patience.”<br></span><i><span style="font-size:14"><br>&quot;Another day has begun. Can you believe I'm going to be 18 soon??&quot; Kairi murmured, hugging her knees.&nbsp; Aiden shook his head. &quot;No I can't. We've been friends so long I've lost track of time. Right now to me you're some old woman!&quot; Kairi yelled and tackled Aiden hard. &quot;That's horrible you rotten old man!!!&quot; Aiden laughed before picking himself up and grabbing up his bow. &quot;Yah, I know I'm a rotten old man. But at least I'm comfortable being a rotten old man.&quot;<br></span></i><span style="font-size:14"><br>While this conversation went on, Agent Lambda was biting her hands until they bled in order not to scream.&nbsp; <br><br>“Oh Eru!&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Why Finrod?&nbsp; Why Lúthien?&nbsp; What did they do to her? And yes, I can believe you are 18 in Tolkien’s sense of 18.&nbsp; It is even too much.&nbsp; You have less brains than a 7 year old human child!”<br><br></span><i><span style="font-size:14">Kairi stood up as well. &quot;Yah well...&quot; she wrapped her arm through his before she snatched his bow and arrows, firing a few to thunk into the trees trunks. </span></i><span style="font-size:14"><br><br>“An Elf hurting innocent trees?&nbsp; For FUN?!”<br><br>Lambda covered her head with her still bleeding hands, and started to wail.&nbsp; She was ready to kill her now, but she had to live through much more before the canon would be disturbed sufficiently for her to have permission to slay the character.&nbsp; Just out of curiosity, she pointed the CAD at her.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br></span><font color="#CC0000"><span style="font-size:14">[Kairi Ciryatan.&nbsp; Female.&nbsp; Original Character.&nbsp; Borderline Mary Sue.&nbsp; Negative Effect on All Things Elven: 98%]</span></font><span style="font-size:14"><br><br>“Somehow, I am not surprised…”<br></span><i><span style="font-size:14"><br>Kairi's parents Luthien and Finrod Ciryatan greeted Aiden like they had every morning since that one day the two friends had met. &quot;Watching the sun come up again?&quot; Luthien asked as she served up some breakfast. Aiden nodded as he sat down at the small family table. Finrod walked up behind Kairi and kissed her head. &quot;Our little girl is sure monotonous sometimes.&quot; Kairi giggled. &quot;Am not.

The song was set to the story of two lovers who met one day and loved one another within the blink of an eye.</span></i><span style="font-size:14"><br><br>In the middle of the song, she suddenly saw a tall Elf with a very angry face walking towards her.&nbsp; Kairi was sure she have never seen her before, in her village or in Galadriel’s party.&nbsp; The Elves around her couldn’t understand why she stopped, and were trying to ask her if she was sick.<br><br>“Can’t you see her?&nbsp; Who is she?” screamed Kairi, suddenly very afraid.<br><br>Agent Lambda understood that her invisibility was lost.&nbsp; She felt archers pointing arrows at her back, and thought that maybe next time she should find herself a lightweight mithril chainmail.&nbsp; <br><br>“I am sorry to interrupt your celebration, my Lady,” she bowed to Galadriel, “but I regret to tell you that this little Elf here committed a few crimes for which, sadly, she must die.”<br><br>Without letting amazed Elves speak, she started reading in monotonous voice, at the same time playing with some strange device (which, of course, was the portally-thingy).<br><br>“Kairi Ciryatan, you are charged with having a stupid name, creating even more stupid names for those around you, creating a forest which tries to be a nightingale, not knowing a difference between Quenya and Sindarin, not knowing the chronology of Middle Earth, altering Elven customs and development, creating ugliest dwellings I have ever seen, and particularly annoying The Poison Ivy and me by insulting Finrod, Luthien, Fingon, Elros, and my other great heroes of old.”<br><br>At the last phrase Galadriel’s eyes brightened.&nbsp; It seemed that canonical Artanis Nerwen was coming through.&nbsp; Whatever she wanted to say remains unknown, because at that very moment Lambda grabbed Kairi and jumped through the portal.&nbsp; Not a moment too late, too, because Aiden shot FOUR arrows at the same time, all aimed at her.<br><br>***<br><br>Kairi found herself on a strange green island in the middle of a large river, with the strange Elf who had brought her here.&nbsp; <br><br>“You see, this is the grave of the REAL Finrod.&nbsp; And you should bow to his memory.&nbsp; Then your death will be a little bit easier.&nbsp; I mean, quicker.”<br><br>Kairi just stood there and trembled.<br><br>“Well, I guess then you have another trip to make,” grinned Lambda and shoved Kairi through a portal.<br><br>Kairi found herself in a dark room with a very evil looking, though very beautiful Elf.&nbsp; When he looked at her, she understood that he was not an Elf at all.&nbsp; <br><br>Sauron just finished reading the letter of the following content: “Do you remember that Elf who defeated you at Tol-in-Gaurhoth?&nbsp; This is she who claims to be her daughter.&nbsp; Deal with her as you will.&nbsp; A.L.”&nbsp; He turned towards the scared Elf and grinned.&nbsp; <br><br>“Now we will have some fun, won’t we?”<br></span><b><span style="font-size:14"><br>THE END</span></b></td>
