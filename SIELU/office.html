     <p>Within Agent Lambda's large office all the walls (except for the one with console) are covered by bookcases full of leather-bound volumes, dog-eared paperbacks, student notebooks with tea spilled on them, papyruses, parchment manuscripts, and other pieces of writing.&nbsp; There are literary works, scientific studies, humorous writings, and all possible writings by Elves, about Elves, or even remotely concerned with the Elves.</p>
     <p>Lambda sees you enter, opens her sleepy eyes and shows you around the place...</p>

      <dd>This is a rather long, detailed essay that briefly touches the history of Elven languages, and discusses what language should be used for which kind of Elves during which time period.&nbsp; Problems and limitations I have come across are also addressed.&nbsp; If you have any questions, or feel I have missed something, or if you find a mistake (<i>Errare humanum est!</i>&nbsp; I am only a human, and not burdened by a degree in linguistics), e-mail me.</dd>

     <p>&quot;You know why I am called Agent Lambda? No?&nbsp; You see, Lambda comes from Quenya word 'lambengolmÃ«', which means, roughly, "a linguist." Someone who studies languages. Oh yes, dear, it is "languages."&nbsp; Exactly that.&nbsp; Do you know how many there are?&nbsp; One?&nbsp; No, who has a better answer?&nbsp; Three?&nbsp; Nope.&nbsp; You see, there are Quenya and Sindarin, but there are also Avarin, and Telerin, and Nandorin.&nbsp; And not to be forgotten are such dialects as Doriathrin, or old forms like Old Sindarin, Noldorin, Ilkorin, or Pra-Eldarin.&nbsp; Read this <a href="http://www.geocities.com/crazyhellga/fanficelvish.html">note</a>, it will help you grasp the idea of who should be speaking what language, dear, it will save PPC agents a lot of time.&nbsp; And you, I see you already know what language your character should be speaking, you just want a good dictionary.&nbsp; Of course I have a couple just for you.&quot;</p>

      <dt><a href="http://www.uib.no/People/hnohf/">Ardalambion</a></dt>
	  <dd>The best site on Elven languages.&nbsp; It has short history and word lists for all major and minor Elven languages, and most other languages Tolkien has created.&nbsp; An excellent Quenya course is also on this site.</dd>
      <dt><a href="http://www.elvish.org/gwaith">The Elvish Linguistic Fellowship</a></dt>
	  <dd>Another excellent resource.&nbsp; This site has the complete analysis of the Middle-earth languages used in the movies, and a ton of articles and resources.&nbsp; This is intended for serious Elvish learners.&nbsp; Explore this site, and you will find something of interest, whether you are an expert in Sindarin consonant mutations and can conjugate a noun through all the Quenya cases, or if your Elvish is pretty much limited to the word &quot;Mellon.&quot;</dd>
	 </dl>
     <p>Take extra notice of all the wonderful links they have on these two sites.&nbsp; Just follow the links, and I don't doubt you will find everything you are looking for, and many things you didn't even know you were looking for.&nbsp; If you have any questions, I will be happy to help you in any way I can.&nbsp; Just send me a note in English, Russian, or German at tar_daedin@hotmail.com or crazyhellga@yahoo.com.</p>
