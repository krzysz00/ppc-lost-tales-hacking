<p align="left"><b>A Little Introduction and Various Feedback-y Stuff</b>

<p align="left">This is the new second home (<a href="http://guil-solo.livejournal.com/" target="_blank">my LiveJournal</a> being the original) of the ongoing adventures of Raphael Sabbat and William Archer – PPC agents, magicians, assassins, spies, PIs and general oddballs. 

<p align="left">Here you will find PPC missions and interludes (that being the main purpose of the site), as well as a few sections from my ongoing fantasy novels (the <i>Saranados</i> series: <i>Saranados</i>, <i>Requiem for the Moon</i> and <i>A Dragon of Blood</i>, as well as the rather inexplicable <i>Black Roses</i>).</p>

<p align="left">Be warned, this site does contain slash (and femmeslash), so if you don't like that sort of thing, I'd recommend hitting the  back button right about now.</p>

<p align="left">If you're still reading this, I guess you don't mind it. That's good... because there's gonna be quite a lot of it. Nothing above a 15 rating, though (for the moment), since I'm ridiculously bad at writing that sort of stuff.</p>

<p align="left">There's also going to be violence, swearing, and dark themes – but isn't that what you'd expect from a fantasy? Although again, nothing above a 15 rating.</p>

<p align="left">So, now that that's over and done with, come in and have a look around. I promise you'll find <i>something</i> to interest you (I hope).</p>

<p><i><font size="5">Editor's Notes</font></i></p>
<p align="left">Unfortunately, two interludes are missing from this spin-off, titled "Interlude" and "Glorious Twenty-Fifth Day/Towel Day Interlude" respectively. They were only hosted on Fynn's LiveJournal, which was friends-locked and subsequently deleted, so as far as I know there's no way to get those back.</p>
<p align="left">Also, I wasn't able to recover any of the <i>Saranados</i> material from the Freewebs site, but Fynn (a.k.a. Gentleman Anachronism) has <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Saranados" target="_blank">a TV Tropes page</a> about the series and <a href="http://gentlemananachronism.deviantart.com/" target="_blank">a deviantART account</a> with writing for the series. Enjoy!</p>
