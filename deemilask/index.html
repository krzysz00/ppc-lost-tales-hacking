<p align="left">One of the many departments in the PPC is the Department of Bad Slash. Slash is a tricky genre to play in. In order to make a slash couple seem reasonable and realistic, one must examine the aspects of both characters and try to find plausible reasons as to why they would be attracted to each other. Good slash is a joy to read, because it can often provide one with a new perspective on the characters. However, it is rare to find. Bad slash, however, is plentiful and when read, makes the readersâ€™ eyes bleed. They mangle the canon characters beyond recognition and have the characters do... tasks that they normally would not do under any circumstances. This is where the Department of Bad Slash comes in...</p>
