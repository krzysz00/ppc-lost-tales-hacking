<div class="box-content">
<p style="font-style: italic">[Black screen. Ominous music plays. The movie-trailer voiceover guy speaks in dark, sonorous tones.]</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold">It was a dark time for the PPC. The Suvians had attacked Headquarters.</p>

<p style="font-style: italic">[Vague shots of a battle involving lasers, sparks, flames, and lots of smoke.]</p>

<p>Voice: d**n the torpedoes!</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold">Makes-Things had been critically wounded.</p>

<p style="font-style: italic">[Silhouette shot of a young man falling to the ground with a thud.]</p>

<p>Voice: Medic!</p>

<p style="font-style: italic">[Slo-mo shot of a crash cart hurtling down the halls.]</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold">And the Sues ran rampant through Middle-earth.</p>

<p style="font-style: italic">[Quick flash shot of an extraordinarily beautiful young Elf maid in the arms of Legolas.]</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold">The Flowers were desperate.</p>

<p style="font-style: italic">[Shot of the SO turning to bloom dramatically into the camera.]</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold">They needed a hero.</p>

<p style="font-style: italic">[Silhouette shot of a woman and a man locked in broadsword combat.]</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold">Instead. . .</p>

<p style="font-style: italic">[Shot of a fuzzy-haired young woman in PPC black holding a melted audiotape with a horrified expression on her face.]</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold">They got Frenchie. . . .</p>

<p style="font-style: italic">[A prolonged, varied and sonorous crash of equipment. A young man raises his dizzy, stunned head into the frame.]</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold">. . . . and Adam.</p>

<p style="font-style: italic">[Shot of Frenchie walking with a video camera through the mountains of New Zealand. Adam walks beside her with a boom mike.]</p>

<p>Adam: (David Attenborough voice) Off to your right, notice the Mary Sue in her native habitat.</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold">The AV Geeks. They have no training.</p>

<p style="font-style: italic">[Shot of Frenchie and Adam in a room full of assorted electronica.]</p>

<p>Frenchie: So what kind of equipment should we bring?<br/>
Adam: I should know?</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold">They have no weapons.</p>

<p style="font-style: italic">[Shot of Adam sitting on Frenchie in the woods. Frenchie waggles a sword.]</p>

<p>Adam: It's got a clever little electronic tip that goes beep.</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold">And they have a major Sue to kill.</p>

<p style="font-style: italic">[Montage of shots accompanied by a loud, wailing, drippy pop version of "Love Is A Song." An elf-child sinks pathetically over a grave. A brilliant smile. An elf-maiden's hair changes from brown to blonde. Her eyes change from brown to blue. She lies in Legolas's arms making googoo eyes at him.]</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold">A Sue with the power of a wizard. . .</p>

<p style="font-style: italic">[Montage. A flash of white light. Gandalf is thrown ten feet and lands on his back. The Geeks hit the dirt. An even bigger red-light shock wave cascades through a forest.]</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold">And the voice of Britney Spears.</p>

<p style="font-style: italic">[Montage, accompanied by horrible singing. The Sue stands in a forest and sings. Flowers bloom. Frenchie writhes in pain. Adam's boom mike explodes. There is an earthquake. Blackout.]</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold">There is only one thing they can do.</p>

<p>Adam: That's inhumane!</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold">And they're gonna do it.</p>

<p style="font-style: italic">[Shot of Frenchie handing Adam a mass of items involving wires and a switch.]</p>

<p>Frenchie: You get to do the honors on this one.</p>

<p style="font-style: italic">[Montage. An elf-child digs a grave. Frenchie reaches for a scimitar. Adam takes a picture. The Sue cuddles a Hobbit. A flight of crebain. Legolas and the Sue bend over a skinny, fallen form. The Geeks run wiring frantically through tree branches. An Orc attack. Adam tackles Frenchie. The buzz of high voltage. Blackout.]</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold">There are no more tickets to the funeral.</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold">The PPC AV Department: Sunrise Elf. Coming soon to a website near you.</p>

<p>Adam: Freeeeeeow!</p>
