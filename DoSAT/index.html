<p align="left">Neshomeh's Note: This section of the archive is a little different. It's an Infrastructure department, so they're not missions, but stories, in chronological order as far as I can tell. Because it's a set of records for a whole department, there are several characters involved and several writers at work. Furthermore, there might even be NEW content here once in a while, so keep an eye open.</p>

<p><i><font size="5">DoSAT Stories</font></i></p>
<p><a href="/DoSAT/story01.html">Story 1 - "Tess's Backstory"</a> by Delta Juliette<br/>How Tess came to the PPC.</p>
<p><a href="/DoSAT/story02.html">Story 2 - "Techno-Dann's Backstory"</a> by Delta Juliette<br/>When Dann joins DoSAT, he faces more than just weird technology.</p>
<p><a href="/DoSAT/story03.html">Story 3 - "Another Tess Story"</a> by Delta Juliette<br/>Tess is abducted by her original author and must fight for survival.</p>
<p><a href="/DoSAT/story04.html">Story 4 - "The Last Hurrah"</a> by WarriorJoe<br/>What happened to Makes-Things during the 2008 Macrovirus Epidemic.</p>
<p><a href="/DoSAT/story05.html">Story 5 - "The Makes-Things Fund for Abused Technology"</a> by Cassie Cameron-Young<br/>Good intentions are misunderstood and the messenger is almost shot, stabbed, <i>and</i> bludgeoned.</p>

<p><i><font size="5">A/V Division Stories</font></i></p>
<p><b>Editor's Note:</b> Originally this was the A/V Department. It has since become a division of DoSAT, hence its inclusion here. I have not changed any instances of "department" to "division" inside the text of these stories; only outside.</p>
<p><a href="/DoSAT/story_av00.html">Story 0 - Trailer!</a> by French Pony<br/>I've always liked trailers. And I was procrastinating at work, and, well, this was the result.</p>
<p><a href="/DoSAT/story_av01.html">Story 1 - Sunrise Elf</a> by French Pony<br/>Adam and Frenchie are put on Emergency Mary Sue Duty during the 2003 Mary Sue Invasion.</p>
<p><a href="/DoSAT/story_av02.html">Story 2 - A Different Flame</a> by French Pony<br/>Hear ye, hear ye! The Balrog Sue has been PPC'd for your reading pleasure.</p>
