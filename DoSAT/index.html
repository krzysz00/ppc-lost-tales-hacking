     <p>Neshomeh's Note: This section of the archive is a little different. It's an Infrastructure department, so they're not missions, but stories, in chronological order as far as I can tell. Because it's a set of records for a whole department, there are several characters involved and several writers at work. Furthermore, there might even be NEW content here once in a while, so keep an eye open.</p>
