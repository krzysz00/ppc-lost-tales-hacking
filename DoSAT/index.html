<p align="left">Neshomeh's Note: This section of the archive is a little different. It's an Infrastructure department, so they're not missions, but stories, in chronological order as far as I can tell. Because it's a set of records for a whole department, there are several characters involved and several writers at work. Furthermore, there might even be NEW content here once in a while, so keep an eye open.</p>

<p><i><font size="5">A/V Division Stories</font></i></p>
<p><b>Editor's Note:</b> Originally this was the A/V Department. It has since become a division of DoSAT, hence its inclusion here. I have not changed any instances of "department" to "division" inside the text of these stories; only outside.</p>
<p><a href="http://plotprotectors.tripod.com/DoSAT/story_av00.html">Story 0 - Trailer!</a> by French Pony<br/>I've always liked trailers. And I was procrastinating at work, and, well, this was the result.</p>
