<p>It was another quiet day in the little corner of Headquarters that Kazra and Rich called their own. Rich was dozing, a book open on his lap. Surprisingly , Kazra was also dozing, looking quite tranquil in repose. Unfortunately, Murphy's Law was having none of this.</p>
<p><b>[BEEEEEEEEP.]</b></p>
<p>Kazra opened one eye, extended one leg, and kicked Rich, before scooting over to the console.</p>
<p>"We off again?" Rich asked lazily, but opened one eye curiously when his partner didn't respond.</p>
<p>Kazra was staring into the distance, one hand tapping against her thigh, muttering something that sounded like. "I am not a lustbunny, I am not a lustbunny."</p>
<p>"Kaz?" Rich asked, sounding slightly worried.</p>
<p>"Hmm?" and Kazra snapped back to reality. "Oh. Mary Sue with special powers, gets into Legolas' pants."</p>
<p>"Do you have to be so graphic, Kaz?" Rich asked, making a move to get ready.</p>
<p>"The fic is worse. Looks like we're going to be elves. Ooh, a perfect opportunity to dispose of her. And I quote, 'uncomfortably like she was readying to pounce.'"</p>
<p>"Sounds fun," Rich said, standing up and waiting for Kazra to activate the portal.</p>
<p><i>Tzzzzing.</i></p>
<p>"I really think that we should get someone to sort that noise out," Kazra noted as they stepped through the portal.</p>
<p>"So where are we?" Rich asked.</p>
<p>"Outside of Rivendell. And we'd better get down because in 5, the Sue will be coming moping over the hill. Four, three, two, one."</p>
<p>Both dropped flat as the Sue appeared, a red/gold hawk flying in front of her.</p>
<p>"That hawk hurts the eyes, no?" Rich muttered. "Is it red, or gold?"</p>
<p>Kazra nodded as she followed the words.</p>
<p>"And she, my dear Rich, is one of those things called a clich√© persona. Or Cinderella syndrome if you like."</p>
<p>"Care to elaborate?" Rich asked curiously before starting to laugh.</p>
<p>Kazra sighed and pushed Rich's head down onto the turf to deaden the sound.</p>
<p>"They're always downtrodden, with a wicked step-person."</p>
<p>"Mumph."</p>
<p>"What did you find so funny?" Kazra asked.</p>
<p>"Mumph."</p>
<p>"Oh, sorry." Kazra didn't sound that apologetic, but released her hold. "Now, what was so funny?"</p>
<p>Rich spat out a mouthful of grass and earth, "I think she's seen the film. She wants to do an Arwen."</p>
<p>"Take the part of Glorfindel?"</p>
<p>"No, sneak up on Aragorn," Rich explained.</p>
<p>"Who wouldn't?"</p>
<p>As the Sue fell in a graceful heap from exhaustion, to be picked up by Aragorn, Rich looked at his partner in disbelief.</p>
<p>"I thought you were a Legolaslover," Rich said, deciding to be tactful and not call her a "Legolustbunny."</p>
<p>"And Aragorn. And Boromir. And to some extent, Eomer."</p>
<p>Rich just shook his head wearily.</p>
<p>"So, my turn to get the Sue?" Kazra asked, peering upwards and watching Aragorn disappear into Rivendell.</p>
<p>"Yep."</p>
<p>"Better start coming up with a list of charges then. First, being a Mary Sue..."</p>
<p>"Can you talk about it while we move? She's heading into Rivendell in the arms of Aragorn."</p>
<p>"Awwww," was Kazra's slightly sarcastic reply.</p>
<p>No one noticed two more elves wandering through Rivendell, even if they were bickering about something.</p>
<p>"Can a person have violet eyes?"</p>
<p>"Someone in the Tortall canon did."</p>
<p>"Sue or character?"</p>
<p>"Character, I think."</p>
<p>"Hmm."</p>
<p>Then a birdlike voice began to sing from up ahead.</p>
<p>"What type of bird? Crow, rook, robin, ostrich, duck?" Kazra muttered at the text.</p>
<p>"Carrying the bow of the Avalons<br/>
From the Eirren tree of Eld<br/>
The last remnant of a tree long gone<br/>
In her small hand she held.<br/>
Eyes a violet not found in any flower<br/>
Her red-brown hair put every deer to shame<br/>
There in the darkest hour<br/>
To the side of good she came.<br/>
The Animal Mind Speaker, the Empath<br/>
At the side of the most unlikely of friends,<br/>
Heedless of the Dark One's Wrath<br/>
She shall bring his evil to its end<br/>
Sweet of face and kind of heart<br/>
Many foul things her young eyes have seen<br/>
To her the shot of a bow is but an art<br/>
Her name is Caraline."</p>
<p>"Prophetic poems," Rich muttered.</p>
<p>"And always so specific," Kazra added.</p>
<p>"Sue," they said in unison.</p>
<p>While Aragorn and Caraline conversed in a garden, Rich was looking at his partner who was holding her head in pain.</p>
<p>"Why do they have to switch authors and idioms midway?" she asked.</p>
<p>"Is it such a problem?"</p>
<p>"Look at what happens after the hawk arrives."</p>
<p>"Oh my." Rich looked startled.</p>
<p>"Exactly." Kazra nodded gingerly, in case her head fell off.</p>
<p>"It's going to be a long charge list."</p>
<p>As a 'seriously hot blond elf' led Cara away to speak with Elrond, Rich prodded his partner.</p>
<p>"We'd better go and watch her screw with Elrond," he pointed out.</p>
<p>"You go, Rich. It only takes one to watch, and I think I'll wait until the paracetamol kicks in."</p>
<p>Leaving his partner to recover from the effects of idioms, Rich headed off to eavesdrop.</p>
<p>"My-my stepfather sided with Sauron. He was sure that good would never win." That was Cara speaking.</p>
<p>"I see. Do you feel the same way?" Elrond there.</p>
<p>"No! I'll <b>never</b> be like him."</p>
<p>Rich stifled a yawn, before stifling laughter.</p>
<p>"I didn't know that Middle-earth has demi-goddesses. Maiar, yes, but goddesses?" he asked a nearby bush which, quite predictably, failed to reply.</p>
<p>After Elrond invited Cara to sit in on the Council, claiming that she could be a valuable asset, Rich left to find his partner.</p>
<p>"Ooh, what a surprise, it's Boromir who doesn't want her to join the Fellowship," Kazra muttered.</p>
<p>"It's always him, isn't it."</p>
<p>"But others are agreeing with him this time."</p>
<p>"Hmm. Wake me when something interesting happens." And Rich closed his eyes.</p>
<p>Kazra rolled her eyes, and resisted the urge to give Rich a hard shove. Instead, she concentrated on concealing her laughter at the absurd test situation that was contrived to prove Caraline was the fabled Bow Maiden.</p>
<p>"Have they never heard of gravity? How can an apple stay in the air for a minute? No one could throw something that could do that," she muttered, before skipping ahead, scanning the words for any other amusing things.</p>
<p>Her eyes widened, and she kicked Rich, hard.</p>
<p>"What was that for?" he asked, blinking and rubbing his abused shin.</p>
<p>"Sue and Legolas sleeping together."</p>
<p>"Oh dear," Rich noted.</p>
<p>"Yep."</p>
<p>Kazra had never been so glad to leave a place before. The words had given her a headache, and images that she <i>didn't</i> need. Rich had solved this problem by lapsing into his usual semi-comatose state.</p>
<p>The pair of assassins lurked behind a statue as the Sue and Legolas left breakfast and began to get ready.</p>
<p>"You might want to brace yourself," Kazra advised.</p>
<p>"Wh...?" Rich began, but was abruptly cut off as the world jumped about them. They caught a brief flash of Saruman, so far out of character that he couldn't reach it with a long pole, shouting loudly. Then they were quickly whirled through Moria, and out the other side.</p>
<p>Rich shook his head once to clear it of confusing thoughts before he focused on where they were now. Lothlorien.</p>
<p>"Are we going to kill her yet?" he asked.</p>
<p>Kazra was flicking through 'The Manual', shifting from page to page in search of something.</p>
<p>"Depends on if it's against the rules."</p>
<p>"Killing Sues?" a confused Rich queried.</p>
<p>"Becoming a character in a fic in order to kill them."</p>
<p>"Ah. Dunno."</p>
<p>"Well, we can always try it and see. Besides, they can't accuse us of going against the character's natural instincts, that's for sure."</p>
<p>"Best get on with it then."</p>
<p>After watching Boromir behaving like a petulant child for a bit (although he was supposed to be under the influence of a spell), the two assassins prepared.</p>
<p>Cara spent a fitful night in Legolas's arms. She was up with the sun. Legolas looked at her groggily.</p>
<p>"What is wrong Lady Cara?" He always called her Lady Cara as a gentle tease. Cara wasn't in very humorous mood.</p>
<p>"Cara." She snapped. At Legolas's surprised look, she softened her tone. "Galadriel gave me some disturbing news. I'll be fine."</p>
<p>There was a knock on the door. Cara pulled on a robe and then went to open it.</p>
<p>There stood an amused Haldir. "You have quite a few visitors Bow-Maiden."</p>
<p>Beyond him were a small pack of timber wolves, many different birds (Cayire was there, too) and - would wonders never cease? - a leopardess. Cayire settled comfortably on Cara's shoulder.</p>
<p>Cara stared. "What is all this?"</p>
<p>Cayire gave a little mental chuckle. "They've come to offer their services. You've become quite popular among the animal circles of Middle-earth."</p>
<p>The leopardess walked up to Cara, who felt that she was in the presence of a queen. The leopardess then bent her front legs in a bow that seemed uncomfortably like she was readying to pounce. Her voice was like velvet in Cara's mind.</p>
<p>"Caraline Avalon, you are charged with being the worst clich√© I have ever seen, possessing powers that have existed in <i>neither</i> canon, no matter how you bend things, giving Sauron a right-hand man, interfering with the characters of Elrond, Aragorn, Legolas, Saruman and Boromir, barely mentioning any other characters or the Ring, giving me a headache, being a Mary Sue, and being highly irritating. Do you have anything to say?"</p>
<p>Caraline just gaped.</p>
<p>"Good."</p>
<p>Kazra stepped out through the portal and immediately grabbed a cup of water and started gargling. Rich followed.</p>
<p>"That was interesting," he noted as he collapsed bonelessly in his usual seat.</p>
<p>Kazra just gargled a reply, before looking for a container.</p>
<p>"Well, at least those wolves will be happy; they got a free meal out of it," Rich said.</p>
<p>Finally Kazra emptied her mouth and was able to speak again.</p>
<p>"Remind me <b>never</b> to do that again," she stated, flopping in her own seat.</p>
<p>"You wanted to," Rich said mildly.</p>
<p>"Yeah, and I'm trying to remember why."</p>
<p>"But she's gone."</p>
<p>"True."</p>
<p>And silence fell, broken only by the console emitting a serious of peculiar clicks.</p>
<p>Rich eyed it suspiciously. "And what do you suppose that means?" he asked.</p>
<p>"It means it's time for my meeting. LA, you know." By the look on Rich's face, he didn't, so Kazra clarified. "Lusters Anonymous."</p>
<p>To his credit, Rich waited until Kazra had stood up, clipped on the highly technically-named "Beepy device" that would allow him to get in touch with her in an emergency, and shut the door behind her, before he burst out laughing.</p>
