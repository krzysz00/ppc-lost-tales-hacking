<div class="box-content">

<p>Agent Emma was once part of the Mary Sue Dept., <i>Sailor Moon</i> Subdivision in the PPC. Expelled from this subdivision for leaving charge notes in a canon universe, she now works in the <i>Lord of the Rings</i> subdivision.</p>

<p>Her favourite things include writing and singing.</p>

<p>Her pet hates include Agent Kate and cold feet.</p>

<p>She enjoys chocolate but has coeliac disease, so can only eat things that don't have wheat in.</p>

<p>She wants to avoid the fabled PPC agents, but also wants to be greater than them. She would appreciate it if you left some <i>Lord of the Rings</i> Sues in her email so she can destroy them.</p>

<p><br/></p>

<p>Agent Kate is a newbie. She is a bit scared of Emma but fights back with her pineapple obsession.</p>

<p>She enjoys chocolate but stays thin, which is one of the reasons Emma hates her.</p>

<p>She likes to be random.</p>

<p>Her pet hates include lying pineapple smoothies and Yannick (her ex-boyfriend who was a pineapple).</p>
