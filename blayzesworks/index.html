<p align="left">I may or may not update this site. Most of my art is being thrown onto LiveJournal. (Author_Blayze) I may update my stories, but they need to be rewritten, and I keep losing the address to my own site. ( Could someone place it somewhere permanent?) I may upload LJ icons here, but I often use LJ for that, too.<br/><br/>

    Also, I am very lazy and haven't gotten on photoshop to edit and upload things, so this stuff here is old and doesn't reflect my drawing style anymore. Hawkelf, you may nick and credit the pictures for the guild website, 'cause I'll delete them eventually and upload better stuff.<br/><br/>

     Please, feel free to email me. I would appreciate it, actually. I get no email. I feel neglected. Okay, I don't, but email me anyway. Contribute to my ego.<br/><br/>


This is a site to host all of my PPC artwork, which may or may not be found at the Neopets Guild site.  <br/><br/>

<u>The PPC:</u><br/><br/>

 The official PPC organization began with two girls named Jay Thorntree and Acacia Byrd. Jay and Acacia were the best and brightest assassins of the PPC, and also the founders. Our mission as The PPC- The Protectors of the Plot Continuum- is to hunt down Badfic and exterminate the cause of said Badfic. I work in the Department of Mary-Sues, and our general term is Assassin. We go into the Suefics, assemble a charge list, and exterminate the sue. Obviously, we aren't very popular with the Fanwriter population- and we shouldn't be. Our closest affiliate is the Official Fanfiction University of Middle-Earth, and its various spin-offs. Miss Cam is generally termed the authority in all things Tolkien, and she rocks. You will see some OFUM art on this site- maybe- and definitely some quotes, which I will have begged to use. OFUM is one of the greatest creations ever, and thus you must check it out.
<br/><br/>
<u>Art:</u><br/><br/>

  My art is not to be taken without my consent, although you may use it as your desktop background, etc. Archiving is to be done by Techno-Dann or Hawkelf only, as they are spiffy and I send them some of this stuff anyway. I do not own LoTR, HP, FFX, or any other various famous things that I draw pictures of. I do not own any agents besides Myself, Lupeias, and Sanguine. The others own themselves. Yay.<br/><br/>
