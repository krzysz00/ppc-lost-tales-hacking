     <p>THE AUTHORESSES' NOTE</p>
     <p>We love fanfic. Honestly, we do.</p>
     <p>But changing the <b>main plotline</b> of the canon story is ridiculous. (Except in speculative AU "what-if" type stories.) And Mary Sues upstage the canonical main characters, which really should not happen. If you want to be the main character, try doing original fiction. Then you can even publish it without breaking copyright laws, maybe even get rich. But if you do that, please knock your character down a few notches from "angel."</p>
     <p>Each fanfic Jay and Acacia enter has its own chapter. The author and fic title are included in the chapter's title.</p>
     <p>Critiques go to Acacia (amy8girl@hotmail.com), because Jay (sonra_jihad@hotmail.com) suffers from an inability to deal with criticism. (even good criticism). Flames go to anyone you like, because they'll just be laughed at anyway.</p>

    <div class="box-content">
     <p>Here, for the first time, all 26 stories of the Original Series are collected for your viewing pleasure.</p>
     <p>With the blessing of the PPC Board, I have given the series a very light editing treatment in order to clean up little things like two-dot ellipses, too-many-dot ellipses, missing commas, punctuation outside quotes, misspellings, etc. (Sorry, Britpickers—Jay and Acacia are American as far as I know, so American usage rules apply.) Words in *asterisks* have been made <b>bold</b> where they are used for emphasis. Where they stand for actions (or it's specifically stated that someone spoke them), they've been left alone. "Makes-Things" seems to be hyphenated more often than not, so it's been hyphenated across the board. Internal consistency is my aim overall.</p>
     <p>Jay and Acacia weren't in the habit of distinguishing badfic quotes from their own text like most of us do now, and that's how I've left it. It's usually easy to spot the difference anyway, since the badfic quotes are <i>bad</i>&mdash;I haven't attempted to clean them up. Rule of thumb: when in doubt, keep reading. There's usually clarification ahead.</p>
     <p>Some stories have two tag lines. In those cases, the first is from Odd Lots, and the second is Miss Cam's.</p>
